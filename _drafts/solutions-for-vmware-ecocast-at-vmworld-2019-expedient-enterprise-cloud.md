At VMworld 2019, I sat down with Scott Lowe from [ActualTech Media](https://www.actualtechmedia.com) to discuss [Expedient Enterprise Cloud](https://www.expedient.com/services/infrastructure-as-a-service/cloud/) (EEC) and the difference between managed service providers like Expedient and the hyperscale cloud providers like AWS and Azure.

#### During our conversation, we discussed the following topics:

* **0:50** – Expedient introduction and the difference between EEC and Hyperscale Cloud offerings
* **6:47** – The architecture of EEC, which is built on top of VMware’s [software-defined data center (SDDC)](https://www.expedient.com/blog/expedient-announces-vmware-cloud-verified-designation/) infrastructure stack
* **9:00** – The user experience provided by EEC, which delivers both streamlined cloud management functionality as well as APIs for power users
* **11:18** – How Expedient supports the hybrid cloud needs of clients, and why Expedient’s telecom carrier beginnings are a differentiator in the cloud service provider space
* **13:03** – Expedient’s multi-cloud journey and our upcoming product strategy focus

#### During the EcoCast, the live audience also asked me several questions, including:

* **16:10** – How do you handle clients with highly secure data?
* **17:42** – What is Expedient’s uptime SLA?
* **18:37** – Does Expedient run its own data centers?

#### We wrapped up by discussing the announcements Expedient made during VMworld 2019, including:

* **22:16** – Expedient’s westward expansion into the Phoenix market
* **22:29** – Expedient’s largest EEC customer to date, [Homes.com](https://www.expedient.com/press-releases/expedient-announces-largest-deployment-of-enterprise-cloud-platform/)
