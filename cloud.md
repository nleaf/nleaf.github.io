  description: |-
    Your enterprise workloads and applications are ready for a migration to the cloud, but a move to a hyperscale cloud provider requires your teams to learn entirely new platforms, demands potential refactoring of your applications, and doesn’t provide you with the inherent security and white-glove managed services you need to keep your business risk-free and running.

    Expedient Enterprise Cloud is cloud the way you want it to be. Leverage your organization’s existing VMware skill sets while taking advantage of a fully integrated VMware stack of technologies, including next-generation vCloud Director, vRealize Operations, LogInsight, NSX, and vSAN. Control your clouds through a beautifully designed, intuitive, and entirely self-service management console that lets you create VMs in as few as two clicks and offers automated provisioning and de-provisioning of resources. And rely upon the built-in, always-on security features of Enterprise Cloud, including Data Encryption at Rest, 2FA, and Active Directory integrations, and Expedient’s 100% SLA, which means your workloads and applications are always available.
