With Category 5 Hurricane Irma bearing down on its headquarters in Clearwater, Florida, Bouchard Insurance’s Director of Information Technology made a critical decision to preemptively failover his entire network to a backup site over 1,000 miles away – ensuring total business continuity and the safety and security of Bouchard employees, and averting an IT disaster. 

At ZertoCON 2018, John White, VP of Product Strategy for Expedient and Brian Polak, Director of IT for Bouchard Insurance, spoke about the days leading up to the failover decision and Polak’s confidence in preemptive failover thanks to Expedient’s Push Button DR solution. **Check out the full video of the presentation:**
