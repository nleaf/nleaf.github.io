Through a recent research study, third-party consultant Cloud Spectator found that the way most organizations are evaluating cloud providers is flawed, potentially leading organizations to select the wrong vendor. While the use of the cloud addresses many challenges often faced by IT departments, there are two little known pitfalls that should be addressed:

*   **Perceived Performance Paradox**: many cloud providers are seemingly comparable because they sell similar services, but they differ greatly when it comes to the underlying hardware architecture and performance.

*   **The Goldilocks Effect:** the common industry practice of offering resources in pre-packaged bundles, rather than allowing customers to determine their own needs. In other words, hosting providers don’t generally offer the resource quantity that’s “just right.”

For the most part, these challenges are caused by differences in the underlying architecture of cloud platforms, which have a tremendous impact on uptime, performance, resiliency and total cost of ownership. This white paper demonstrates how decision makers should evaluate and research potential providers to find the perfect fit for their organization.
