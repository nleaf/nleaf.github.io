Another cause of service outages is network connectivity. A loss of connectivity resulting in downtime can lead to a number of negative business impacting events. **What causes a loss of connectivity?**

* Equipment failure
* Software crash
* Human error
* Denial of service (DoS) attacks
* Fiber cuts

Companies that manage network connectivity in-house to support mission critical applications are more susceptible to experiencing downtime due to loss of connectivity, as it is cost prohibitive to design the same level of redundancy that a commercial data center provider would implement. Typically, the capital cost and monthly operating costs of establishing a fully redundant and resilient network in addition to supporting such a network is prohibitive. As such, these companies will make use of one Internet carrier, creating a single point of failure. **Furthermore, companies that manage network connectivity in-house:**

* Will not have access to the number of different carriers that a data center provider does
* May not be multi-homed
* May not utilize BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
* Are probably only able to use a single network provider; if using more than one, they’re relegated to one physical fiber entrance.

All data center providers should offer a redundant network setup — this is common to the industry, and a standard benefit to utilizing a data center partner.
