## Are Your Getting the White Glove Treatment?

Most data center and managed services providers offer the promise of an always available computing environment. 

But keep in mind, the operative word in that above sentence is promise. And unless that promise is backed by a dedicated and knowledgeable team of analysts, engineers and support staff, you may find those solutions are lacking. 

Regardless of whether you are looking for a provider who offers a simple [cloud computing solution](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/) or someone who offers more involved [colocation services](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/virtual-colocation/), the IT solutions you receive are only as strong as the support and customer service provided. Without a team dedicated to providing continuous customer service, how can you be certain that your computing environment will always be available?

#### Demand More From Your Managed Data Services Provider
