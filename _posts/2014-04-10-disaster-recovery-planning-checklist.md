## Your Disaster Recovery Toolkit: Network Availability Basics

**Question:** If a disaster were to affect your IT infrastructure, how long could your business survive? 

**Answer:** Unless you actively test your disaster recovery plan, chances are you will be [out of business within one year](https://www.expedient.com/how-much-does-downtime-really-cost/ "How Much Does Downtime Really Cost?"). Take note: less than 50% of U.S. corporations actively engage in the testing of their disaster recovery plans.

#### Evaluating Your Disaster Recovery Plan:

To ensure the protection of your business critical data and the continuous availability of your network, it’s imperative that you evaluate the scalability, testing and risk impact of your current [disaster recovery plan](/managed-services/disaster-recovery/ "Disaster Recovery as a Service"): 

**Scalability:** Not every disaster happens on a large scale. In fact, more than 50% of system failures are attributed to localized power outages or IT failures – not a major disaster. To ensure a wide net of protection, your disaster recovery plan needs to account for disasters of varying scales. 

**Testing:** Your infrastructure, as well as threats to your infrastructure, will continue to evolve at a lightning pace. (For instance, a recent merger acquisition may have added an extra layer of complexity to data recovery). This is why testing—both planned and surprised—needs to take place on a routine basis. While this may put a drain on internal resources initially,think of every test as an opportunity to discover, strengthen and eliminate weaknesses. With this in mind, your disaster testing should:

* Occur once every six months—at minimum
* Encompass your entire infrastructure, including data and application stored off-site
* Offer insights for updates and enhancements

**Risk Impact Analysis:** As your business grows, evolves and changes, so will the risks. For this reason, it is advisable to create a risk impact analysis report, one that you will update every time you conduct your business continuity tests. Remember, risk analysis should include calculating the actual costs of downtime:

* Loss of sales orders
* Impact on invoicing and reduced cash flow
* Negative impact on the quality of customer service
* Missed deadlines
* Idle or underproductive employees
* Need for additional human resources

Of course, the best solution is to not just prepare for this downtime, but to prevent it. This is where Expedient can help.
