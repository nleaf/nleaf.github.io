At VMworld 2019, VMware encouraged attendees to “Make Your Mark.” The Expedient team answered that call as the [VMware Americas Cloud Partner of the Year](https://www.expedient.com/blog/expedient-named-vmwares-americas-cloud-partner-of-the-year/) with its first ever sponsorship of the event, an exhibition booth in the Solutions Exchange, multiple educational session presentations, client case studies, and technology testimonials. More than twenty Expedient team members traveled to San Francisco to participate in the event, which was held at Moscone Center and several surrounding hotels.

Our booth in the Solutions Exchange offered a unique opportunity to conduct demonstrations of our VMware Cloud Verified Expedient Enterprise Cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) solutions.

In addition to our booth presence at the conference, Expedient sponsored several hospitality events at VMworld, including:

* **Americas Party** – Along with CDW and Dell EMC, Expedient was a sponsor of the annual party celebrating VMware clients. Attended by both Pat Gelsinger and Michael Dell, attendees also included other company executives and all participants enjoyed food, drink, and music while networking late into the night.
* **Hall Crawl** – Expedient was one of only twenty vendors out of the 225 with a presence in the Solutions Exchange to offer free drinks during this annual happy hour event that draws a high volume of attendees to vendor booths. The company was the only participant to offer ice cream treats, making our booth particularly popular with the crowd that late afternoon.
* **Tailgate Party and San Francisco Giants Baseball Game** – Along with our partner Cohesity, we sponsored a pre-game happy hour tailgate at Oracle Park featuring the #CohesityOnWheels demo truck, food, and drink. Participants had the opportunity to take a photo with the Giants World Series trophies!
* **Private Performance of HAMILTON the Musical** – Along with our partner Cohesity, we offered our prospects and clients the opportunity to attend this exclusive performance at SHN Orpheum Theatre. More than 2,000 attended.
