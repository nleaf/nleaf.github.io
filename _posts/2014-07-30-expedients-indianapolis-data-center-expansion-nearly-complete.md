Expedient is excited to announce that the expansion of their Indianapolis data center, which kicked-off in early 2014, is near completion and will be finished this summer. The expansion includes over 6,000 square feet of new, production ready, raised floor computing space, immediately adjacent to the existing data center. Upon completion, the total raised floor footprint in Indianapolis will exceed 25,000 square feet. 

To celebrate the addition to our data center, we are hosting a Grand Opening - Open House event, which will take place on September 4th at our Carmel data center. We invite our customers, partners as well as members from the IT community and business leaders to attend, and walk through the new space.  Technical engineers and executives from Expedient will be on-hand to answer questions and discuss upcoming projects.  Expedient is excited about the prospect of continued growth and we look forward to the opportunity of building new relationships and sustaining old ones.
