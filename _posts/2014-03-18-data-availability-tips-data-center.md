## Tips from the Data Center: Ensuring the Availability of Your Data

Here is an unfortunate bit of reality: Customer loyalty is fleeting—even the most trusted and valued customers will leave you if they suspect the IT infrastructure housing their private information and supporting your company is not secure. This is why [any interruption to your network](https://www.expedient.com/how-much-does-downtime-really-cost/ "How Much Does Downtime Really Cost?"), data or services (regardless of how small) is monumental. Your customers need instant answers and fast results, and if you are unable to deliver the level of service they expect, they will go searching for someone who can.

#### Solving the Data Availability Challenge

At Expedient, we have put together a list of three solutions that companies are using to ensure continuous data availability:

* [**Disaster Recovery:**](/managed-services/disaster-recovery/ "Disaster Recovery as a Service") The continued operation of an organization depends on your awareness of the potential for disturbances in core services and your ability to develop a plan that minimizes the disruption of critical functions. This is where disaster recovery planning can become critical.Without a well-balanced disaster recovery plan, you are vulnerable to operational disruptions caused by everything from nature, technology failure, infrastructure deficiencies and human activities.
* [**Cloud Computing:**](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/ "Cloud Computing") Cloud computing has become a low-cost way to ensure that your data remains available and continually accessible. For organizations whose IT needs continually expand and evolve, the cloud offers a way to expand data capacity, storage and availability without any additional investments in infrastructure.
* [**Managed SAN**](https://www.expedient.com/managed-services/shared-san-storage/ "Shared SAN Storage")**:** A Storage Area Network (SAN) solution, which enables storage systems to be shared on a network and offers a fully redundant architecture, is a great choice for improving high availability. Of course, the initial investment in a SAN solution can add up to a major expense—with hardware and software investments ranging anywhere from $50,000 to 250,000 in the first year. However, a managed Storage Area Network SAN solution can allow you to purchase the disk space you need without a major upfront investment.
