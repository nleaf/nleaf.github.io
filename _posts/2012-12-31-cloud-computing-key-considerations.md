## Cloud Computing: Key Considerations

The benefits of a [private ](https://www.expedient.com/products/cloud-computing/private.php)or [hybrid cloud](https://www.expedient.com/products/cloud-computing/hybrid.php)  are certainly intriguing. You receive the full access and capabilities of a private computing environment, just without the expense, hassle or maintenance responsibilities tied to owning a physical infrastructure.

This, however, certainly does not mean that you can just choose any available cloud computing solution. There is not one “all mighty cloud” where your data and applications are stored and managed. Instead, your options are almost as wide-ranging as the number of cloud providers available – with each available service and solution directly dependent on the provider you choose.

When researching the available cloud computing providers, there are three keys areas to consider: Security, Availability and Mobility. Understanding the provider’s approach to each area can help you identify the solution best suited to meet your needs:

#### Security

With cloud computing, you are entrusting the security of your mission sensitive data to a third party. The provider must be able to meet industry regulations and compliance needs. It is also equally important for them to be able to illustrate who has access to your data, and what systems, infrastructures and environments your data touches throughout its life-cycle.

#### Availability

How does the provider ensure up-time and data availability? The Service Level Agreement (SLA) can offer some insight into the provider’s capabilities. Keep in mind, however, that even SLAs that offer 100% guaranteed up-time may not provide the protection you need, as many are capped at the monthly service fee – an amount far less than the cost to the business if the service becomes unavailable or if data is lost.

#### Mobility

For many businesses, the adoption of a cloud computing solution is a multi-step process – one that begins with virtualization and colocation, and then transforms into a private and then public cloud solution. It is important to ensure that the provider offers physical colocation along with their cloud offerings. This allows for the seamless communication of data and applications across physical and virtual platforms.
