## Data Center Options - Should I Build or Buy?

For any growing and thriving organization, having enough data center space to match expanding computing needs is paramount. But what happens when demand begins to outpace supply? Should you build or add on to your current data center? Or should you buy and rent from a [data center provider](https://www.expedient.com/company/locations.php), and hold them responsible for providing the space, power and cooling? The truth is that strong cases can be made for both sides of the argument:

* **_On the Pro Side of Building:_**  You maintain control over the facility and the operations
* **_On the Pro Side of Buying:_** Operating expenses are often minimized, while your ability to quickly expand your computing resources is increased.

### Taking a closer look at outsourcing your data center needs

While there are a few good arguments on the side of building, outsourcing is becoming an emerging trend – with many companies citing the concentration of resources as a primary reason. Keep in mind, however, that resources and expense savings are just a small part of the larger picture. Other factors that go into the buying decision include:

#### Build Time

The typical data center can take anywhere from 12-18 months to build. On the other hand, outsourcing with a data center means you can be up and running much sooner.

#### Expertise

Regardless of how well trained your internal IT staff is, running a data center is probably not the core of their expertise. But when outsourcing with a data center provider, you get the peace of mind that comes from knowing your mission critical data is in the hands of the experts.

#### Shared Resources

Colocation and cloud computing providers build for multiple tenant use. This means you are sharing the fixed costs related to management, security, and facility maintenance.

#### Expense

While building costs and infrastructure maintenance are obvious expenses as they relate to building a data center, the costs of staffing is often overlooked – this includes training, employee benefits licensing fees.
