With global demand for its behavioral health software rising, Baltimore-based [mdLogix](https://mdlogix.com/) knew that it would need to migrate its suite of software solutions to the cloud. As a longtime colocation customer with Expedient, the technology company knew that it could count on Expedient to migrate its business-critical environment to the cloud without costly operational disruptions or downtime. To deliver the enterprise-grade cloud environment that mdLogix required to continue its digital transformation, Expedient built the company's cloud environment on top of Dell EMC hardware and supported it with various managed services such as [Unified Threat Management](https://www.expedient.com/services/managed-services/compliance-security/unified-threat-management/), [Dedicated Firewalls](https://www.expedient.com/services/managed-services/network-access/firewall/), and [Managed Backups](https://www.expedient.com/services/managed-services/backup/). Additionally, as the mdLogix [BH-works software platform](https://mdlogix.com/the_platform/) handles incredibly sensitive personal health information, the company required a highly secure, available and confidential cloud solution that would safeguard patient information. As an IaaS provider that is both [HIPAA compliant](https://www.expedient.com/services/managed-services/compliance-security/hipaa-compliance/) and [SOC 2 Type 2 certified](https://www.expedient.com/services/managed-services/compliance-security/service-organizational-control-reporting/), Expedient delivered a totally secure and highly available cloud solution. Watch the mdLogix video case study to learn more about the company's successful cloud migration.
