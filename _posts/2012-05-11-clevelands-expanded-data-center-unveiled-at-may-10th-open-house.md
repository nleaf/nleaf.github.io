More than 100 companies joined us at our Garfield Heights facility on May 10th. We really enjoy hosting these exclusive, one-time only, Open House events as it give the community the opportunity to take a tour of a world class data center and learn about compelling new trends in the data center and managed hosting industry.  We always welcome tours for individual companies but this was an opportunity to showcase our services to a broader group of people. We invested over $4 million dollars as part of this expansion project, which is our sixth expansion at the Garfield Heights data center within the last four years. Upgrades consist of adding 7,000 sq. ft. of raised floor data center space and an additional two (2) additional 750 KW Caterpillar Generators, 240 tons of cooling, two (2) additional Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) units, and Expedient’s 4th generation of cloud and virtual hosting pods.  Before these recent upgrades, the facility previously boasted 14,000 square feet, two redundant UPS's, 300 tons of cooling, FE-25 fire suppression, dual diesel generators, video camera surveillance, bio-metric hand scanner entrance, lockable cabinets, and cloud and virtual hosting pods. Thanks for the continued support!
