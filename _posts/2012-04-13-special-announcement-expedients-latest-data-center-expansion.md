Since joining Expedient more than 10 years ago, I’ve enjoyed many changes and a lot of exciting times. The purpose of this note is to share even more great news. First, we are once again opening more Data Center Space at our NEO Park Campus, and second, I have been assigned the privilege of “Official Spokesperson” for announcing the Grand Opening to our many valued customers and friends. Therefore, I am delighted to invite you to join us, as we celebrate the opening of our “Phase Six” Data Center, at 152 Neo Park in Garfield Heights, on May 10th, 2012. This is our 2nd Major expansion in the last 3 years!   [**Register NOW!**](https://www.expedient.com/) **May 10th is right around the corner, so if you haven’t already done so, please RSVP by visiting** [**https://www.expedient.com/152expansion/**](https://www.expedient.com/)  **Invited guests are welcome at any time between 11:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M.  Refreshments will be served throughout the day and our Solution Engineers will be on hand to conduct tours of the new facility and to answer questions.
