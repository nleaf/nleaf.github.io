Do you have industry or government compliance requirements such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, GLB, SOX or others? Ensuring proper security measures and adhering to regulatory compliance requirements can be a difficult undertaking for a company running an internal data center. Understanding the challenges of security and compliance are paramount in following industry and government standards. Finding a qualified hosting partner is an ideal alternative to addressing such challenges alone. **Why?**

*   The rules for physical security create a large distraction for organizations. Physical access logs, video retention systems, badging systems and external audits become very time consuming and expensive. With a reputable data center service provider that is audited, all of these requirements are inherent to the services that they provide.
*   Enterprise-class providers have HIPAA business associate agreements used to protect personal health information in accordance with HIPAA.
*   Extensive third-party auditing of the data center, as well as the auditing of the processes and procedures for customers that require compliant facilities is taken care of.

If you’re currently evaluating your company’s approach to security and compliance, considering a cloud or data center provider may be a viable option. Adhering to compliance requirements is imperative, but it doesn’t have to be a challenge.
