## Demand Drivers for a Cloud-based Data Center

Managing a data center is a constant race to keep pace with various elements including, new technology, new security issues, requirements of new applications, power and cooling systems, ensure there is enough infrastructure to support the data that comes with a growing business.

It's also a constant race to maintain or minimize certain components including costs, unnecessary overhead and most importantly downtime. For those companies that are looking for stability and high availability of services, serious consideration should be given to migrating to a cloud-based data center provider.

Leveraging a data center provider rather than running and managing your own data center is a big change, which requires careful consideration. As you establish your data center and cloud strategy, consider the following:

#### Are you ready to make a change?

If your infrastructure is reaching its physical limitations, you anticipate rapid future growth or you need to move to a new location; a [cloud computing environment](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/) will enable you to not only establish a more cost-effective model, but will also allow you to scale resources at a lower cost per unit compared to continuing to operate your own data center environment. In a cloud-based data center environment, your expense model shifts from a heavy capital expense with operating expenses to a pure operating expense model. You benefit from leveraging the capital outlay of the cloud-based data center provider.

#### Should you use the public, private or hybrid cloud?

Security issues are always at the forefront when moving data and applications to the cloud. Virtual machines enable multiple organizations to run in separate environments on the same physical hardware, but in cases when additional security is required, dedicated private cloud environments offer the same benefits such as redundancy and scalability with additional security. Look for a provider that offers environments that comply with standards such as HIPAA and PCI-DSS.

#### Does your provider need to offer managed services or just the physical infrastructure?

Cloud-based computing comes in several models. In the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model, the data center provider sets up your infrastructure and virtual hardware, but you are responsible for all of the software. In Platform as a Service (PaaS), the environment also includes the software and services that streamlines application deployment. Software as a Service (SaaS) adds end-user applications into the configuration.

#### What data centers house your cloud environment?

The cloud can be everywhere, but your data still needs to have a home. For disaster recovery purposes, cloud providers should have [multiple data centers](https://www.expedient.com/the-data-centers/) in areas that have low risk for natural or man-made disasters. Additionally, service level agreements with providers should have thresholds that clearly define uptime and availability of services.
