## Bullet Proofing Your Business with Disaster Recovery

#### Don’t become another IT statistic

Why is disaster recovery important? Consider this startling statistic: of companies that experience a **_computer outage lasting for more than 10 days, half of them will be out of business within five years._** This statistic is even more alarming for businesses located within an area where Mother Nature routinely unleashes unexpected surprises—places like Indiana’s “Tornado Alley” or the hurricane-prone eastern seaboard. In these areas, where natural disasters are not the exception but the rule, lacking a [disaster recovery plan ](/managed-services/disaster-recovery/ "Disaster Recovery as a Service")is simply asking for trouble. The statistics bear this out: Companies that have a [disaster recovery plan](/managed-services/disaster-recovery/ "Disaster Recovery as a Service")—one they frequently update and test—can rebound at a surprisingly fast rate. On the other hand, according to a study conducted by the University of Texas at Arlington, **43% of companies** that experience a disaster but have **no recovery plan** in place **go out of business.** These statistics obviously raise questions about your business and the state of your disaster recovery plan. 

**When evaluating whether your business is prepared for unexpected downtime, consider the following questions:** 

* Are regular data backups prepared daily? 
* Are your applications and operating environments also backed up on a daily basis? 
* Where are these backups kept? Are they offsite? 
* How often does your data need to be replicated? 
* How much of your data changes from day to day? 

The above are just a few questions you need to consider when exploring your disaster recovery options. To learn more, [contact Expedient today](https://www.expedient.com/support/ "Support").
