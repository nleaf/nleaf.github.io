It’s no secret that network routing and hardware issues compromise performance, often resulting in outages. That’s why [Dataforma](https://www.dataforma.com/) contacted Expedient during their search for a quality provider that could guarantee 100% uptime, as well as a smooth transition of services. They needed a partner that could assure quality performance and support their requirements for availability and budget. Expedient teamed up with Dataforma to create a comprehensive solution that includes the management of firewalls, routing and virtualization, and a reliable IT support system.

They’ve also been able to take on projects requiring new hardware and upgrades, while enjoying flawless internet access with zero downtime.
