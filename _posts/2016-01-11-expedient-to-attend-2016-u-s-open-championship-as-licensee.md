Expedient, a leading provider of data center colocation, cloud computing and managed hosting services, is a licensee of 2016 U.S. Open Championship being held at Oakmont Country Club in Oakmont, PA, June 13-19, 2016. 

"We are very excited to attend the 2016 U.S. Open Championship and celebrate the Pittsburgh community at the event in June,” says Shawn McGorry, president of Expedient. “It is going to be a great experience for our team to be at the venue and see it live. Anytime we can support Pittsburgh in a positive way, we want to be involved, and this is a great opportunity for that.” This will be the 9th U.S. Open to be hosted at Oakmont Country Club but the first for Expedient as a licensee with a table in the hospitality tent.
