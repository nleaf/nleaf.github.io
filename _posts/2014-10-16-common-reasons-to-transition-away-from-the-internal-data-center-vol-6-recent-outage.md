## Experiencing an IT Outage

Experiencing a natural disaster or an unplanned outage is a valid reason to look at moving your IT environment to a professional data center provider. In doing so, you will benefit from multiple layers of built-in redundancy for power, cooling and network connections. The burden and stress of ensuring resiliency and uptime shifts from your organization to the data center provider. Physical security affords a peace of mind that comes with knowing who has access to your data. Additionally, your company’s responsibility is limited to your application—your data center provider will take care of the rest.

If your business has been affected by a natural disaster or experienced downtime, you may have a viable reason to start looking to an outside data center.
