## Desired Business Outcome

First Insight, a provider of cloud-based solutions that help retailers determine trends, depends on consumer data to deliver the solutions its clients need. To provide that data, First Insight must have reliable infrastructure, and for that, it depends on Expedient. “We wanted to make sure that we have the right kind of partner solution vendor who has our back when it comes to our technology,” says John Santore, manager of hosting operations for First Insight. “We needed somebody who can rapidly deploy additional resources, who’s got all of the standard hosting things – redundant power, etc. – and we liked the fact that Expedient is local to us.” With its dependable infrastructure and the scalability to ensure compute power during growth or peak usage times, Expedient was able to deliver on all of the tenets that First Insight was looking for in its IT partner.
