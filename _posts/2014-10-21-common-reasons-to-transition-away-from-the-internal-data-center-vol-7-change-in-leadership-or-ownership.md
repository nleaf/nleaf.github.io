## Leadership and/or Ownership Change

Leadership changes often cause short-term uncertainty within a business. New leaders bring fresh ideas and expect fast results. It’s important for leaders and their teams to focus on core business objectives and avoid the distraction that sometimes go with maintaining a high capacity, highly available IT infrastructure.

During a time of executive transition, it is imperative for an IT team to demonstrate quick success and build the confidence of their company’s leadership team.

* Often times with a change in leadership comes a modification in strategic direction, which can lead to re-focusing IT resources from internal infrastructure to business critical applications.
* As new leadership and/or ownership establishes their objectives, often times a desire to minimize capital and rely on subject matter experts to provide data center services occurs. This presents an opportunity for the company to leverage an enterprise-class facility.
