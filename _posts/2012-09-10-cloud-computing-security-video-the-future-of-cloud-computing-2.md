Expedient’s Alex Rodriguez Shares His Vision on the Future of Cloud Computing
=============================================================================

At this year’s 2012 VMworld® Conference in San Francisco, Expedient’s own Vice President of Product Development and Systems Architecture, Alex Rodriguez, took a few minutes to chat with representatives from Intel. In this short video, Alex shares his thoughts on the future of cloud computing, and he addresses any potential security concerns - which have up to this point impeded the adoption of cloud environments among some enterprise clients. The video outlines Expedient’s and Intel’s plans to alleviate those security concerns. As Expedient continues to build upon their scalable cloud environments, the primary objective has been to help businesses execute IT strategies that are meaningful for growth and development.  Over the next five years, Expedient will continue to meet the needs of enterprise businesses by: • Designing security specifically for the enterprise • Creating cloud security that is even more secure than it is today • Continuing to scale our cloud solutions from both a capacity and performance perspective Interested in learning more about the scalability and security that the Expedient cloud has to offer?
