**“The most important part of working in the Operations Support Center is giving people the best possible customer service while quickly and efficiently solving problems.”** _-Sam Larkin, Expedient Engineer, Operations Support Center_ 

Every hosting provider should guarantee around-the-clock support and customer service through the management and monitoring of infrastructure and cloud services, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Support at Expedient means that each of our data center facilities are manned by experts that have the ability to address, escalate and solve technical issues while providing outstanding customer service. 

At Expedient, we provide Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 support, each responsible for differing areas of problem resolution. How do Operations Support Center (OSC) technicians spend their days? 

Evan Loftus, Tier 2 Technician at Expedient, describes a day as an OSC employee at Expedient: 

_“When I get to work in the morning, I put myself in the queue to be contacted if needed; some tickets are automatically assigned to me, so I look over my tickets. When it comes to high visibility tickets, I work with the customer care team to communicate with the customer and resolve the problem. Throughout the day, I balance multiple tickets, working to provide great support to our customers. It’s important to provide updates in a timely manner so that customers stay informed on the resolution of problems and requests at all times.”_ 

This is the kind of attention that should be expect of all hosting providers. As a customer, you deserve peace of mind and the ability to trust that if there’s an emergency after hours, there are people at the facility who will fix the problem before business starts the next day. 

#### What should you expect of your hosting partner’s support center?

* A team of experienced technical experts
* 24x7x365 availability
* Consistent and timely updates and performance reports
* A thorough hiring policy including mandatory drug testing and background checks to ensure only the best and most trustworthy candidates join the team.

A knowledgeable support staff is a must when it comes to forming a partnership with a hosting provider. Accept nothing less than superior support when it comes to where you host your data and critical applications.
