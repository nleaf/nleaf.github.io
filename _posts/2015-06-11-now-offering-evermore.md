In response to customer demand, Expedient is now offering a new archival cloud storage service: **Evermore**. Many businesses have large warehouses of data not regularly accessed, containing information that may need to be reviewed in the future. Rather than spending the valuable time of your employees sifting through data now, Evermore can be used as a low-cost archival storage plan that allows you to access and review files you’ve collected when it’s convenient for you. 

As the industry moves away from using backup tapes and premium high-speed disk for long-term retention of data, Expedient can provide triple redundant, economical storage to meet all retention requirements while providing fast, easy retrieval when the need arises. Evermore provides the ability to scale incrementally while eliminating compliance concerns.
