# Partnering for Success

Expedient offers the highest-performance technical solutions, in part because of an extremely reliable converged computing infrastructure built with Intel technology. Software Defined Infrastructure (SDI) is a major focus for Expedient because it enables the automation of policies in each component of the computing and networking infrastructure. These capabilities facilitate on demand resource availability leading to faster deployment – something that continues to be incrementally enhanced by Intel over the course of more than a decade operating public and private infrastructure as a service (IaaS) clouds.
