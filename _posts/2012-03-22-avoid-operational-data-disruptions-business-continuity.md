#### How to Avoid Operational Data Disruptions 

Does your company have a data disaster and recovery plan in place? Well believe it or not, if you answered “Yes,” you may actually be in the minority. According to [DRPlanning.org](http://www.drplanning.org/portal/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16%3Aabout-dr-planningorg&Itemid=40&limitstart=1 "DR Planning"), at least half (but probably more) of all US corporations do not undertake disaster recovery planning. This fact becomes a tad bit more alarming when you consider that when a company is “denied access to mission critical data for more than 48 hours, they will likely be out of business within one year”. It may sound scary, but the simple truth is that disasters happen – and they can happen to your business. The trick becomes not avoiding the disaster altogether (although that would be great), but avoiding the operational data disruptions which affect the very future of your business. 

#### Data Disaster Recovery Planning: Be Prepared 

Without the right business continuity plan, any type of unplanned interruption, including a natural disaster, technology failure, infrastructure deficiency, or human error, can cause a loss of key mission critical data, which in turn will negatively impact the future of your organization. With so much riding on your business continuity plan, it is important to take a proactive approach to creating a [disaster recovery plan](https://www.expedient.com/managed-services/disaster-recovery/ "disaster recovery plan"). The problem too many companies face is they mistakenly view Disaster Recovery Planning as being overly complex and extremely expensive. When in truth, a business continuity plan that offers a viable solution to protecting your businesses data can be both affordable and effective.
