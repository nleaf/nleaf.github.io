When it comes to online retail, rapid spikes in traffic happen, sometimes resulting in degraded website performance.   This was the problem [Thirty-One Gifts](http://www.thirtyonegifts.com/) was experiencing when they approached [Expedient](https://www.expedient.com/ "Home") with the need to optimize their IT infrastructure. They needed to be able to support increasing levels of activity without impacting their website. 

Expedient partnered with Thirty-One Gifts to establish a cost-effective infrastructure solution that provides the required I/OPs, flexibility, uptime and support.   [Read Thirty-One Gifts’ story](http://bit.ly/1p4pohM) to find out more about their experience. 

**What were their results?** Thirty-One Gifts chose to migrate off of their existing infrastructure and onto the Expedient platform over a two-month period. The migration project was completed on time and to the overwhelming satisfaction of the team at Thirty-One Gifts. The environment has been running with an uptime of 100% on the Expedient platform for more than a year.
