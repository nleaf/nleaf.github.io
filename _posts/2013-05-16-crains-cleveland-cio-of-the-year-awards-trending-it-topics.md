With Northeast Ohio’s top CIOs and IT thought leaders all gathered together at this year’s [Crain’s Cleveland CIO of the year awards,](http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20130417/FREE/304189997/0/SEARCH) Expedient Data Centers jumped at the opportunity to canvas the room, asking award finalists to share their insights on trending IT solutions, services, and issues.

What we discovered is that while cloud computing, along with its corresponding compliance and security demands, was the trending topic (as it has been for much of the last few years), attendees also wanted to share their thoughts on an array of additional subjects, including mobile technology and the demands of BYOD.

Check out this video for a look into what was on everyone’s mind:
