Data Center Security
--------------------

### Enhancing Data Center Security Standards

When looking at the recent news surrounding technology vulnerabilities, you'll notice the headlines are mired with announcements ranging from intrusions, to data breaches as well as an increase in cyber-crime-related incidents. The future of IT is extremely promising but it is also rife with hazards and the increasing threat of fraud and crime. To protect corporate and customer data -- as well as to meet the current and evolving security and regulatory compliance demands of transacting in today's and tomorrow's business environments -- you must ensure that your data center is up to par with the requisite requirements.

### Evolving Threats and Evolving Standards

Recent cyber crime and corporate accounting fraud are the two driving elements behind the current focus on security and regulatory compliance. Legislation and measures exist to enforce corporate governance and IT oversight in areas such as data privacy/security, control mechanisms and infrastructure process optimization -- to minimize both the occurrences of breaches and compromises, as well as identifying material weaknesses in financial reporting. As the cloud and related advancements continue to spur innovations in domains like software development/delivery, cyber criminals -- augmented by the same technologies -- will, in turn, become craftier in their intrusion methods. IT security has also raised the bar for intrusion detection/protection solutions, firewalls and network monitoring devices in line with the ongoing rise in cyber threats. The latest systems are capable of advanced anomaly detection and predictive analysis. Firms with older or more rudimentary security configurations will find themselves exposed and easy targets for attack.
