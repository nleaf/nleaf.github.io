At VMworld 2016, John White, Vice President of Product Strategy for Expedient was joined by Thomas Hobika, Director, Service Provider Solutions Engineering for VMware, to present the featured session **_Virtualize, Secure and Extend Your Data Center to the Cloud Using NSX_**_: A perspective for Service Providers and End Users_. 

The session describes how both service providers and end users can benefit from VMware NSX capabilities. It is targeted at a business and technical audience. John and Thomas describe the value proposition that capabilities such as L2 VPN, dynamic routing, and micro-segmentation bring to service providers and end users. This session also discusses how using NSX could seamlessly connect multiple disparate clouds (for example, on premises to service provider cloud) and could dramatically simplify and automate disaster recovery.
