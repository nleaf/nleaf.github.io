### Data Center Checklist

100% uptime, security/safety, 24x7x365 support and a Tier IV Data Center rating; sound familiar? It probably does, since this is the type of marketing lingo most data center providers use to attract customers. These assertions are important; however, beyond technical support and physical security, how can you be sure your data center provider has all of the assurances your company really needs? 

We’ve created a data center checklist to help you be aware of the key factors you should be thinking about when vetting your current provider, or looking for a new one. Here are a few key points to keep in mind when you’re evaluating your current or potential data center provider:

* Vendor stability
* Capacity/scalability
* Risk due to building location
* Redundancy and resiliency
* Full solution set
* SLA
