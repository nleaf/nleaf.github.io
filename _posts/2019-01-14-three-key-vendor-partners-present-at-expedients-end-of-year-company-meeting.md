Executives from three major vendor partner companies presented perspective on their organization’s relationship with Expedient at our 2018 end-of-year company meeting. Participants included:

* Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy for [Dell Technologies](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/index.htm)
* Vice President of Product Management, Cloud Software Business Unit for [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/)
* Senior Director, Specialist Systems Engineering for [Juniper Networks](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/)

Each presentation showcased the unique nature of Expedient’s partnership with the respective organization. Some key takeaways included that Expedient is:

* A top 2% VMware cloud services partner in the U.S.
* A top 3 partner for Juniper’s vSRX virtual firewall worldwide
* A model Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for DellEMC with a 100% OPEX model

All three vendor partners shared a common perspective that a **hybrid, multi-cloud approach** will be the predominant characterization of information technology deployments in the future, which aligns to Expedient’s evolving product roadmap. In 2018 alone, we launched [Expedient Enterprise Cloud](https://www.expedient.com/blog/expedient-cloud-evolution-a-vision-5-years-in-the-making/), [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://www.expedient.com/vmc-on-aws/), and [Multi-Cloud Connection](https://www.expedient.com/services/infrastructure-as-a-service/connectivity/multi-cloud-connection/), all designed to help clients [facilitate hybrid IT strategies](https://www.expedient.com/blog/john-white-on-thecube-multi-cloud-and-it-resiliency/). 

Partner alignment is an important attribute of Expedient’s go-to-market strategy to deliver best-in-class cloud technologies and complementary managed services. Our team will continue to leverage these relationships to assist clients in achieving desired business outcomes.
