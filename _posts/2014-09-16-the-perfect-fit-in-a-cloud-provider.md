##### What is the difference between a partner and a vendor, and how do you find the perfect fit in a prospective cloud provider? 

When it comes to cloud providers, there are two kinds of organizations: partners and vendors. A traditional cloud vendor cloud vendor typically sells resources in pre-determined packages. As a result, unless your resource demand happens to align perfectly with a vendor’s offerings, you could be strapped for sufficient resources, or end up paying for unused resources. Furthermore, it is unlikely that you will be able to visit the data center to review which standards are followed, and to see exactly where your data lives. 

From a support perspective, long wait times may occur and the resources you interact with may not have a complete understanding of your environment. A partner-centric cloud provider will provide tailored solutions that fit your requirements and work with you to understand your needs. Ideally, you’ll have the option to tour the data center facility and receive a thorough briefing regarding security measures and facility details, including the power, HVAC and network redundancies that are in place. When your environment is up and running, experienced support analysts and engineers should be available at all times for any questions or issues.
