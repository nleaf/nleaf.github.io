The concept of bimodal IT has been around since at least 2013, when Gartner first introduced the phrase as a way to address the burgeoning growth of agile development in IT organizations. In Gartner terms, Mode 1 is the focus on making sure the business runs reliably, while Mode 2 explores opportunities for innovation that leads to business transformation. Combining a more predictable evolution of technologies (Mode 1) with new and innovative approaches (Mode 2) underlies enterprise bimodal capability. And while sophisticated IT organizations have likely been “bimodal” since long before Gartner crystallized the concept, bimodal IT is taking a new turn with the continued adoption of platforms that democratize technology – empowering Mode 2 developers, while further complicating the ecosystem that Mode 1 needs to support. _Network World_ took on the topic of bimodal IT head on, and included insight from Expedient’s VP of Product Strategy [John White](https://www.expedient.com/blog/post-authors/john-white/) on how Expedient is tackling bimodal IT internally and for its customers.
