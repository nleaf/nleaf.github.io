Disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) has really expanded in popularity over the last couple of years due to the growth of virtualization as a standard process for many enterprises and the fact that most managed service providers have a DRaaS product in their offerings. But according to a new research paper by 451 Research, it is Expedient that has changed the game and significantly improved DRaaS. 

Expedient’s Push Button DR 2.0 DRaaS solution removes the manual process of failing over an IT environment from one network to a different network in a separate location by using VMware’s NSX.  The second location can be either an Expedient data center or an external location, such as a customer’s in-house data center. 

Push Button DR 2.0 allows for a fully virtualized connection from site to site and eliminates the need to switch networks and update DNS records completely, meaning all network functions will experience no disruption except for the pause in traffic during the spin-up of remote instances in a failover scenario. This is a notable improvement to the usual process. Expedient’s solution also allows for some applications – those without a lot of data – to come back up in minutes rather than hours.
