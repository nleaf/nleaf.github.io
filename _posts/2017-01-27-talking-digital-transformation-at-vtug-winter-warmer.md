Digital Transformation
======================

The Virtualization Technology User Group (VTUG) Winter Warmer took place Jan. 19 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., with Expedient’s Boston team and Vice President of Product Strategy John White in attendance. Expedient led a breakout session on achieving a work/life balance in the tech world, and White sat down with Stu Miniman, senior analyst at Wikibon, to discuss Expedient’s product roadmap and the trends we are seeing in the industry. **The Transition to the Private Cloud** Chief among the topics the two discussed was digital transformation. As the need grows for businesses to uniquely position themselves digitally, in-house IT organizations are often stretched too thin, tasked with not just their operational tasks but supporting or driving the company’s business strategy as well. This is leading many IT leaders to consider migrating from in-house data centers to the private cloud from a hosting provider, freeing up valuable time and resources to focus on more strategic business needs. White noted that Expedient’s 2016 sales reflect these trends. Thirty-five percent of Expedient’s new sales were private cloud, and disaster recovery as a service business more than doubled last year.
