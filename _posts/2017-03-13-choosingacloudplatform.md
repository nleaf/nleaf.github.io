## What's Your Cloud Strategy?

Once your organization has gone through the [three-step process of defining your cloud strategy](https://www.expedient.com/blog/the-importance-of-a-defined-cloud-strategy/) and determined that the cloud is the right option, then it is time for the next decision: Choosing a cloud service platform. This is another significant choice that requires thoughtful evaluation.  Is your business IT infrastructure best suited for a public cloud, a private cloud or a combination of the two, utilizing a hybrid cloud concept?

#### First, you must understand the differences between each platform.

In simple terms: The [Public Cloud](https://www.expedient.com/services/infrastructure-as-a-service/cloud/public-cloud-computing/) is a multi-tenant environment where you pay a service provider for the resources you use, i.e. applications, storage, etc. It is a shared environment that is available over the Internet.

The [Private Cloud](https://www.expedient.com/services/infrastructure-as-a-service/cloud/private-cloud-computing/) is a single-tenant environment devoted solely to your company’s infrastructure. Private cloud users have full administrative access to their hypervisors, allowing for much more control over network operations and maintenance.

The [Hybrid Cloud](https://www.expedient.com/services/infrastructure-as-a-service/cloud/hybrid-cloud-computing/) is generally defined as a combination of private and public cloud services. This can be an in-house private cloud with a public cloud via a third-party provider, or multiple private and/or public clouds hosted in a provider’s data center. With clarity on the differences between platforms, you can better evaluate your options using these rules of thumb as guidelines:

#### Choose the public cloud if:

* Business growth and/or resource usage fluctuates.
* You would rather spend money on monthly operational expenses than capital expenses.
* Staff is limited and you don’t want to commit internal IT resources to basic day-to-day tasks.

#### Choose the private cloud if:

* Security and compliance are your top priority or you are in a regulated industry, such as health care or banking.
* Your business and networking demands are unpredictable.
* You want to maintain total control over your environment.

#### Choose the hybrid cloud if:

* You have legacy applications or hardware that are not cloud-ready.
* You plan to migrate to a complete cloud solution as existing hardware expires.
* You have some highly sensitive data that you want to continue to host privately while utilizing benefits of a public cloud for less critical data.
