## Disaster Recovery: The Technology & Strategy You Trust

You’ve most likely heard the adage; _it’s not a matter of if IT systems will fail--but when._ So even if you are confident that your organization is equipped to handle failure, or perhaps has even recovered successfully from an outage in the past, having the right recovery strategy in place is vital for ensuring overall business continuity. To this end, choosing the right provider for disaster recovery infrastructure is crucial for eliminating the risk of data and system loss during an outage or crisis.

Today’s IT environments make it more challenging than ever to implement effective, comprehensive backup routines—especially when it comes to restoring data when and where it's needed. The vast array of BYOD devices in today’s workplaces, coupled with the plethora of commercial and homegrown cloud-based applications, can make restoration a complicated affair, especially when use-cases can vary greatly. There is no one-size-fits-all solution—infrastructure providers must be able and willing to provide custom solutions based on each customer’s unique requirements and business drivers.

Expedient’s disaster recovery solutions are created to fit the unique requirements of each customer. With eleven data centers in seven geographic markets, Expedient gives customers the freedom to choose which location fits their user base’s needs. By eliminating a single point of failure through multiple data centers, interconnected fiber facilities, and multi-vendor network providers, Expedient’s offerings are effective solutions for ensuring business continuity.

A few of the most common ways in which Expedient is able to assist a customer’s disaster recovery requirements include: [**SAN-to-SAN virtual replication**](https://www.expedient.com/managed-services/disaster-recovery/san-to-san-replication/ "SAN-to-SAN Replication"), [**host-to-host virtual replication**](https://www.expedient.com/managed-services/disaster-recovery/host-to-host-virtual-replication/ "Host-to-Host Virtual Replication") **and** [**virtual firewall failover**](https://www.expedient.com/disaster-recovery-3/hosted-dedicated-firewall-failover/), among others.

* With SAN-to-SAN virtual replication, data is replicated between any of Expedient’s eleven data centers. Failover testing with this option can be conducted by the customer with the push of a button.
* Host-to-host virtual replication features replication between customer hardware and an Expedient data center. This option is suitable for specialized IT infrastructures that require solutions that complement existing virtual environments.
* Virtual Firewall Failover allows you to migrate your network to a second data center, without manual intervention, during a DR event.

Disaster recovery services must be available and resilient. In the event that your business experiences a disaster or a significant interruption, you are relying on the DR plan to work; otherwise, the business is at great risk. Expedient’s services, such as the three highlighted above, are designed to simplify the recovery process and eliminate single points of failure. These services are predicated on ensuring uptime and availability and they are backed by a 100% guaranteed SLA. We employ high performance and resilient platforms so that services are always available. Expedient’s infrastructure is architected with multiple layers of redundancy to ensure high availability of resources.

These offerings also complement various compliance requirements customers must adhere to, such as SOX, PCI DSS and HIPAA, among others. In short, your business must rely on a partner that can deliver uptime and high availability of services, and platforms. During a disaster recovery situation, you need to focus on applications and human resource elements while your partner ensures the availability of infrastructure resources.
