**_Learn what Expedient is doing to ensure security and eliminate compliance concerns_**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In [a recent blog post](https://www.expedient.com/how-cloud-computing-adoption-varies-across-industries/ "How Cloud Computing Adoption Varies Across Industries"), we mentioned that the rate of cloud adoption can vary from one industry to the next. And according to a [Gartner research report,](http://www.gartner.com/id=2027216) this has led some companies in regulatory industries (e.g. banking, insurance, healthcare) to take a hesitant approach when looking to expand their cloud initiatives. The result of this has been that, while these companies are more than willing to turn to the cloud for business support (e.g. sales, service support, and collaboration), concerns surrounding data security and privacy have made them slow to apply the cloud across other competitive operations. **A Data Center Built to Meet Stringent Regulatory Standards** These direct concerns about security and compliance are why Expedient has worked to ensure our cloud solutions are engineered to meet changing regulatory standards. Not only are our [state-of the-art data centers ](https://www.expedient.com/the-data-centers/ "Data Centers")built to ensure SSAE compliance, but when our clients require additional levels of compliance we use our managed services and cloud computing platforms to design client specific solutions that adhere to the most stringent standards across the financial, healthcare, and payment card industries – including, but not limited to, compliance with:

*   PCI-DSS
*   Sarbanes Oxley
*   HIPPA

In addition, we also recognize that not every cloud computing solution is right for everyone. While some data is a match for a public cloud other data needs to remain physically separate in a private environment. In order to address this range of challenges, we have committed ourselves to building solutions that can be tailored to meet your unique needs:

*   [_Public Cloud_](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/public-cloud-computing/ "Public") _–_ _ The Expedient public cloud provides quick access to robust computing resources without the associated costs of deploying your own environment._
*   [_Private Cloud_](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/private-cloud-computing/ "Private") _–__ For the benefits of the cloud and the security of a separate environment, the Expedient private cloud is a great option._
*   [_Hybrid Cloud_](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/hybrid-cloud-computing/ "Hybrid") _–_ _ Offering the option to house some of your data in a public environment while other applications remain physically separate in a private environment, this option is a great choice for many regulatory companies._
