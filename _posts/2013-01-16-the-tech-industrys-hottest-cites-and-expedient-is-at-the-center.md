What city offers the most promise for landing a job in the technology industry – According to a recent [article released by Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/edgl45eldd/methodology-11/ ), the answer is Washington D.C. ![data centers](http://blog.expedient.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/map_states-1024x753.png "Expedient Data Centers") Citing research conducted by the Praxis Strategy Group and information collected from the U.S. Census, Forbes released a listing of the top ten cities with the fastest growth in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics-related) employment over the last decade. What may be surprising is that the largest growth in tech related jobs is not taking place in the traditional large metropolitan cities – areas like Silicon Valley, New York and Chicago. (Actually, both Chicago and New York lost tech jobs during the last ten years) Instead, some of the most notable sustained growth in recent years has been occurring in smaller cities - cities like Baltimore, which just so happens to be home to one of our eight strategically located [data centers](https://www.expedient.com/company/locations.php). Forbes’s listing of top ten cities for tech jobs was not the only surprising bit of news included in the article. One more item of note includes the double-digit rate of expansion for tech employment in Columbus, OH – another city that Expedient proudly calls home.
