Many businesses colocating or using cloud storage still depend on their internal staff to manage their own systems. IT infrastructure must be managed, but at what cost to your business? Imagine the list of projects your staff could complete if it weren’t for the day-to-day, mundane requirements of internal systems management.

In the midst of focusing on running your business, the underlying IT infrastructure is sometimes neglected. As a result, you may experience:

* Midnight runaway server processes, causing application latency
* Hard drive failures causing loss of disk redundancy
* Low disk space alarms, halting email delivery

Considering a partner for handling the management of internal systems is a viable option for most companies seeking to focus on what’s important to the core of business. Allowing a team of experts to keep your infrastructure healthy allows you to do what you do best.

Here are some of the benefits to allowing a partner to manage your infrastructure:

#### Managed backups or configuration archives

The partner is responsible for the backups, ensuring reliable, healthy copies of data are consistently available either local or offsite.

#### Hardware break-fix (if physical)

Support contracts with numerous vendors are maintained to provide quick hardware repair or replacement around-the-clock.

#### 24x7x365 support

Expert team of individuals with a wide array of expertise staffed around-the-clock to ensure infrastructure reliability.

#### Provider is responsible for overall health and uptime of the infrastructure component

Your infrastructure is supported by expert experience and knowledge, including upgrades, fixes, monitoring, support and patching items often neglected when running your business is the priority.
