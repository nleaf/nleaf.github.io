TIC Gums is using [Expedient’s On-Site Private Cloud with Disaster Recovery as a Service](http://bit.ly/2vMh4ih) to meet several business objectives, including the modernization and migration of its aging IT infrastructure and the creation and implementation of a disaster recovery plan and solution. By placing an Expedient private cloud point of delivery (POD) on-site at TIC Gums’ premises, TIC Gums is able to ensure continuous business operations through a “lift and shift” phased workload migration approach. 

Watch as TIC Gums' Brian Hensley, Director of IT, and Steve Mathur, IT Infrastructure Manager, discuss how Expedient is helping their organization achieve a scalable, secure, modern infrastructure through the On-Site Private Cloud with DRaaS.
