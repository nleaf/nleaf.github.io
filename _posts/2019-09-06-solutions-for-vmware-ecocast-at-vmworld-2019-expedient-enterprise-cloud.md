At VMworld 2019, I sat down with Scott Lowe from [ActualTech Media](https://www.actualtechmedia.com) to discuss [Expedient Enterprise Cloud](https://www.expedient.com/services/infrastructure-as-a-service/cloud/) (EEC) and the difference between cloud and managed service providers like Expedient and the hyperscale cloud providers like AWS and Azure. During our conversation, Scott and I discussed the architecture of EEC, the EEC user experience, how Expedient supports the hybrid cloud needs of its clients, and why our telecom carrier beginnings differentiate Expedient as a cloud service and disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) solution provider.

We wrapped up the conversation with on overview of our multi-cloud journey and the major announcements that Expedient made at VMworld 2019. If you would like to learn more about these announcements or how Expedient Enterprise Cloud can streamline your organization's cloud transformation journey while saving you money, watch the interview:
