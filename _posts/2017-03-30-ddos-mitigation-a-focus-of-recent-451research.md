## DDoS Mitigation

#### DDoS mitigation a focus of recent 451 Research analysis at 2017 RSA conference 

A March 2017 report published by 451 Research found that distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks evolved in 2016, requiring security vendors addressing such threats to take proactive measures to increase their capabilities and capacities. The research cites Arbor Networks, an industry leading threat intelligence provider, as having measured the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of DDoS attacks to have been 44% over the preceding 5 years. Expedient utilizes Arbor Networks’ technology to supplement our [DDoS Mitigation](https://www.expedient.com/services/managed-services/compliance-security/distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-mitigation/) solution that protects all clients with Internet Access service subscriptions because digital business interruption comes at a significant cost including – in many cases – lost revenue. 

The 451 report was informed by the author’s attendance at the annual RSA Security conference in San Francisco earlier this year. Several vendor solutions in addition to Arbor were reviewed, including the approach of multi-vendor combinations to form multiple security layers in order to protect high value targets – the success of the website for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio was cited as such an example. 

The Expedient [DDoS Mitigation](https://www.expedient.com/services/managed-services/compliance-security/distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-mitigation/) solution is included with our [Gigabit Internet Access](https://www.expedient.com/services/infrastructure-as-a-service/connectivity/gigabit-internet-access-service/) service at no additional cost. It provides protection from known malicious hosts, application-layer exploits like botnets and malware, and other threat vectors like reflection/amplification attacks just to name a few. Mitigation of the risks associated with DDoS attacks is an important capability for our clients. As threat vectors increase over time, Expedient continues to offer a variety of [compliance and security solutions](https://www.expedient.com/services/managed-services/compliance-security/distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-mitigation/) that meet the emerging needs of its cloud and data center infrastructure as a service clients in Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, Columbus, Indianapolis, Memphis, Pittsburgh and beyond.
