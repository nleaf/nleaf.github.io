Customers, local dignitaries, and business leaders joined Expedient in Pittsburgh on January 25, 2018 for the public reveal of the Nova Place (formerly Allegheny Center Mall) data center expansion. Hundreds of guests enjoyed tours of the data center and even more joined us for food, drink, and networking with vendor partners – including Cloud Genera, Commvault, Dell EMC, Nutanix, VMware, and Zerto – in the Cloud Lounge at Alloy 26, a public co-working space transformed into a hospitality suite for the day.

Both the City of Pittsburgh Mayor and the Pittsburgh City Council issued [proclamations declaring the day to be “Expedient Day” in Pittsburgh](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pittsburgh-city-council-and-mayors-office-proclaim-january-25-to-be-expedient-day-in-the-city-of-pittsburgh-300588369.html), and a formal ribbon cutting ceremony in the data center was attended by Councilman Corey O’Connor, Pittsburgh City Council; Tom Link, Director of Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh; Chris Heck, President & CEO, Pittsburgh Airport Area Chamber of Commerce; Robin Rosemary Miller, Executive Director, Northside/North Shore Chamber of Commerce; Bradley Ott, Vice President Commercial Operations, Faros Properties; and Audrey Russo, President & CEO, Pittsburgh Technology Council. 

The Nova Place data center expansion – which was completed in November – added 10,000 square feet of new raised floor computer room space and cloud capacity for IaaS and disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) solutions. Several thousand additional square feet were dedicated to fully redundant switchgear, UPS systems, and emergency generators. Additionally, the renovated and expanded facility is powered by new dedicated and redundant commercial utility power service. Several regional media sources covered Expedient's announcement and the event itself:
