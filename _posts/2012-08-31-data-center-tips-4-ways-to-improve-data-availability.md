## Four ways to Improve Data Availability

In today’s modern business landscape, your customers expect instant answers and immediate turn-around times. And, you cannot let things like remote locations and system interruptions prevent you from delivering.

The following four tips offer insights on improving data availability, which will ultimately help you better deliver on your promises to your customers:

• **Eliminate single points of failure**: Every part of you infrastructure needs to be continually backed up and reinforced. Be sure to review you IT system’s architecture, and explore managed service solutions such as virtualization, redundancy, load balancing, and clustering.

• **Prepare for a disaster**: A disaster does not have to be a major act of Mother Nature. Instead, a simple localized power outage can limit your access to critical company data. You can protect against any interruption to your data by exploring [disaster recovery solutions](https://www.expedient.com/managed-services/disaster-recovery/) that include cloud computing or colocation.

• **Engage in proactive monitoring**: An optimized and regularly updated disaster recovery plan might be a great way to protect against the loss of data, but proactively monitoring your servers can help you avoid the disaster all together. Engaging in services that proactively monitor your servers ensures that your data remains protected and accessible.

• **Explore virtualization**: [Virtualization and cloud computing solutions](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/virtual-colocation/) have become an instrumental part of ensuring data availability. With your servers, applications and other IT resources securely stored in a separate independent data center, you receive the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your data and critical company information is always backed up and always available.
