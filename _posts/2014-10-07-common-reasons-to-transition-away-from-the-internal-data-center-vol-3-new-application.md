Developing and managing a new application can be a complex undertaking. Doing so while managing and maintaining an internal data center can also tax an IT organization and may ultimately delay the successful completion of your project.

So the question is, can you afford to manage the infrastructure components while giving equal attention to developing the application?

There are a range of application solutions available to support early development projects with highly available production environments, guaranteeing that you have the right resources to make your applications accessible and available. Allowing a reliable cloud provider to manage your infrastructure lets your IT staff focus on the applications that drive your business.
