Is your hardware reaching the end of its life cycle? 

A hardware refresh can be complex and cumbersome, and may require a significant capital expenditure. When purchasing hardware, you must forecast your needs well into the future. As a result, you are most likely paying for capacity that you do not need in the near-term, or risk performance issues as capacity is exceeded. 

Leveraging the cloud is a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to the challenges and expenses of managing hardware refreshes. Cloud solutions enable organizations to increase capacity and capability as business needs dictate. 

You can create your cloud solution, whether it be public, private or hybrid. This allows you to focus your time on the application that drives your business, rather than worrying about the hardware.
