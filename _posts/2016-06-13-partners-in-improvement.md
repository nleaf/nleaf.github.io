## Taking Partnerships to a New Level

Many managed service providers partner with outside technology vendors to develop complementary solutions or improve upon existing products to deliver the most value for their customers.

Expedient takes that partnership approach to a new level. Expedient partners with industry leaders so that we can offer the best technology and top performance for our customers while staying current with the trends. As Chief Innovation Officer of Expedient, I sit on several advisory boards and work with our partner companies on a regular basis to provide feedback regarding new products or technology. In working with some of the most valued experts in the industry, Expedient has likewise become a trusted partner to many organizations in search of expertise on all facets of managed and data center services.

The vendors also expect Expedient (or whatever managed service provider they work with) to provide information back to them so it is truly a two-way partnership. That information will include growth with that vendor’s product/services and consummated sales from leads or projections provided by said vendor. Each partnership is mutually beneficial in their own unique way.

When working with partners, it is important to Expedient to showcase that collaborative effort to our customers and the partners’ customers. In all of our seven geographic markets, Expedient does so through a variety of co-sponsored events. Look for an event in a city near you. All Expedient events can be found on our [website](https://www.expedient.com/expedient/events/).

The companies that Expedient has a working partnership are:
