Just how important is a reliable and continually tested [business continuity plan](https://www.expedient.com/the-data-centers/) to the success of your business. Well consider this:

* 93% of companies that experience a major data loss **_go out of business_** within five years1
* Medium sized businesses (101-1000) experience an average of 140 hours of  downtime **_every year_** – with an average loss in revenue of 867,000 dollars
* 43% of businesses that experience a disaster but have no business continuity plan in place **_never recover_**

Right now you are probably saying to yourself, “My company is safe. We invested in a [disaster recovery plan](https://www.expedient.com/expedient/news-articles/) a few years back. And on top of that, we are located in a region where disasters seldom strike.” Unfortunately, this is a mistake that far too many companies make. A pre-existing business continuity plan or low occurrence of “natural” disasters has them believing that they are immune to data loss. But the facts don’t match up with the statistics:

* Only 14% of businesses update their business continuity plan regularly – And an out of date plan is about as good as no plan at all.
* More than 50% of system failures are due to localized power outages or IT failures – Not a large scale natural disaster
