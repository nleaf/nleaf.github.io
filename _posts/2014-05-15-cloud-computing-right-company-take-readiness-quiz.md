## Is Cloud Computing Right for Your Company?: Take the Readiness Quiz

Cloud computing solutions have recently received a big push from managed service providers and the internet has become crowded with articles, advertisements and blog posts all touting the benefits the cloud has to offer. [Download Expedient’s Public Cloud vs. Private Cloud Whitepaper](http://bit.ly/13wTtS4) for expert analysis on the advantages of cloud computing. The [advantages of cloud computing](https://www.expedient.com/exploring-the-why-of-the-cloud/ "Exploring the ‘Why’ of the Cloud") include:

* Eliminate the need for investing time, energy and money into a physically separate hardware infrastructure.
* Maximize and improve network security, bandwidth and computing capacity, all while saving money.

#### The Cloud Quiz

* Does my business model require a network system that can scale up quickly to accommodate unplanned growth?
