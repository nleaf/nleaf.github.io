## Three Reasons Why Virtualization is for You

At first glance, [virtualization](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/virtual-on-demand/ "Virtual On-Demand") may sound like something straight out of a science-fiction movie, but it has become an integral part of a data center.

The benefits of virtualization are many, but let's look at the main three:

1. Simplify IT Management
2. Cost reduction
3. Getting to the Cloud

#### 1) Simplify IT Management

Who doesn't want to simplify their life? IT is changing so rapidly that trying to keep up can be exhausting.

With virtualization, planned maintenance and upgrades can be completed with less scheduled down time. Virtualization can also feed directly into your IT disaster recovery plan.

#### 2) Control Costs

At the end of the day, cost drives most business decisions. Virtualization can reduce costs in a number of ways. The most basic is with reduced capital expenses—with virtualization there is no need to buy new equipment. Since you only pay for what you use, your operating costs will go down as well.

Virtualization with Expedient will also provide you with a fully monitored and managed solution with redundant power, helping to reduce the risk of business loss as a result of downtime.

#### 3) Prepare for Cloud Migration

Finally, [there is the cloud](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/ "Cloud Computing"). Virtualization is the platform that can take your business to the Cloud.
