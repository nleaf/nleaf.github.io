The average American consumes more than 140 pounds of potatoes each year. But did you know that this popular side dish can also serve double duty as a battery. In fact, with enough potatoes you could power just about anything:

* 600,000 potatoes are capable of powering one 60 watt light bulb
* 3,300,000 can power one server
* 26,400,000,000,000 could power a single 10,000 sq. ft. data center

That’s right, with enough potatoes; you could power your entire computing environment. The question, however, becomes who is going to manage that same environment? From the electricity to the operating system, who can you turn to for continuous, secure high availability and continuous network solutions?
