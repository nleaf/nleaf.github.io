## Desired Business Outcome

With its automation and interface tools that address regulatory integration challenges in order to simplify laboratory workflow in more than 1,400 laboratories across the country, Orchard Software must have reliable IT services from a partner that it trusts to handle all of its critical data. The company found this—and other qualities—with Expedient. “From Internet to colocation to cloud hosting offered to our clients, Orchard has been very satisfied with the services provided by Expedient since we first became a customer in 2004,” says Seth Bosworth, associate director of information services for Orchard.
