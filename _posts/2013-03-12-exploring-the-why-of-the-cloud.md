### The motivation supporting the cloud computing revolution may not be as obvious you first suspect.

The cloud computing revolution is hitting full gear. Fueled in a large part by the CIOs of small to medium sized companies, cloud strategies are being implemented at unbelievable rates - a trend that doesn’t look to be going away anytime soon. Just look at some of the industry forecasts:

* CIOs are naming cloud computing as their number one priority for 20131
* Forrester predicts that the global market for cloud computing will grow from $40 billion to more than $241 billion by 2020.2
* Gartner predicts that the cloud will become so commonplace that IT professionals will stop calling it the cloud - and instead they will begin to use more specific terminology

#### Cloud motivations are not all tied to saving money

While these forecasts for cloud computing adoption rates are impressive, they certainly are nothing new – as industry forecasts about the impending cloud revolution have been well documented. However, a recent [Forrester Research Paper](http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=226469). takes these forecasts, and asks one important question: “Why?” – As in why are companies turning to the cloud at such an impressive rate. As noted by the Forrester Research Report, cloud adoption is up despite not always proving to be a less expensive alternative. In fact, many CIOs have already made investments in more traditional forms of IT; and any additional investments in the cloud could appear counter intuitive. On top of this, cloud computing opens up more opportunity for additional IT – meaning that through the cloud “enterprises will increase their consumption of IT, which will raise overall IT costs, not lower them.”

#### Then why the cloud?

The answer to this question has to move beyond the mere promise of cost savings. There is a reason that Gartner states “The cloud will change IT as nothing before it has.” And that is because the cloud offers businesses the opportunity to do more things faster and better:
