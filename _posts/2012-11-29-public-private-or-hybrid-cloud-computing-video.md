## Public, Private or Hybrid: Latest Video Explains the Difference

The concept behind cloud computing seems simple enough. In the most basic sense, the cloud allows businesses to increase their computing capacities and capabilities without investing in additional hardware. Things, however, begin to become a little more complicated as you take a deeper dive into the full breadth of offerings available – and with terms like “Public,” “Private” and “Hybrid” being bandied about, the whole process can become overwhelming. This is where Expedient can help. 

In our latest video, we explain the differences between the three main cloud computing environments: Private, Public, and Hybrid.

Using an apartment complex as a metaphor, our video illustrates how users within a public cloud receive their own separate and secure computing environment, while the costs of maintaining, upgrading and securing the environments are shared among the other tenants, leading to lower overall expense. On the other hand, the private cloud offers many of the same advantages as the public offering, but instead of resources being shared among multiple users, you have the whole “apartment complex” to yourself. And while costs may be higher in a private environment, it can lead to greater security and help to ensure regulatory compliance.
