## Intel processors and their power output

## Do you need to increase your processing power?

Cloud Spectator commissioned a study to measure the processor and memory performance of Expedient’s virtual machines across Intel’s third, fourth, fifth and sixth generation of Xeon processors. The goal of the study was to understand how Intel processor performance has increased over time, using Expedient’s virtual environment as a practical cloud compute to test in. RAM performance was also examined to account for the overall performance of the server. 

Recording results from nine test iterations over three days, Cloud Spectator ran the same benchmark tests across Expedient’s 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th generation offerings. Tests were run from May 11-May 13, 2015, and were conducted on 15GB servers with 4 vCPUs. Cloud infrastructure performance across virtual machines is an important aspect for potential customers to consider, especially when utilizing a public cloud environment. In the public cloud, resources are shared across virtual machines within the same physical server, therefore using the same processor.

#### So what does this all mean?

Cloud Spectator found that virtual servers with identical resources but newer generation of Intel Xeon processors deliver more processing power and better memory performance, allowing end users to receive additional performance without buying more resources. With Expedient’s Gen 6 PODS, customers are able to process 20% more data with the same resources, and some critical areas, such as encryption processing, saw a 254% increase in performance. The memory bandwidth performance of the Gen 6 PODS tested exceptionally better than the previous generations. The average memory bandwidth for the Gen 6 environment was 7625 while Gen 5 was 5152. This means that applications on the Gen 6 environment with the Intel Xeon processor E5 v3 family offering perform better or that they may require less resources. 

By hosting with an enterprise cloud provider like Expedient, companies can benefit from constantly improving performance instead of waiting 3-5 years for hardware refresh cycles. In addition, another added benefit of hosting is the time, planning and manpower that you would spend if you implemented your own hardware. All of these tasks are eliminated when you work with Expedient, powered by the latest Intel® Cloud technology. Expedient’s newest data center, now open in Dublin, Ohio, hosts a Gen 6 POD.
