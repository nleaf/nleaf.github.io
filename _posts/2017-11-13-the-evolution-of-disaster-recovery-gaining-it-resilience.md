Whether power or software failures, network outage or natural disaster, major data disruptions to critical business applications are the norm, not the exception. These disruptions cost companies billions of dollars annually. Why? Businesses fail to meet basic BC/DR requirements, by not establishing true IT Resilience. During our recent "Evolution of Disaster Recovery" webinar with Zerto, we discussed critical aspects of DR, including:

*   What is BC/DR, and why is it important?
*   What are the basic considerations towards achieving true IT Resilience?
*   What are key questions to ask to ensure total data protection aligns to my goals?
*   What is the true impact to my business from a single disaster event?
