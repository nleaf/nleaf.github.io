For most companies, the question surrounding [cloud computing](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/ "cloud computing") does not come down to its advantages. In truth, there is little doubt that cloud computing services are a cost effective solution, allowing companies to expand their data capacity and system capabilities without investing in their overall infrastructure. When it comes to cloud services, the question invariably turns to which option is the best: public, private, or some hybrid version of the two? While each option has its distinct advantages, learning the differences will ultimately help decide which solution is best for your business.

#### Benefits of Private Cloud Computing:

Private clouds are a relatively newer addition to the cloud computing world, and they share many of the same benefits and functions of a public cloud. The major difference, however, is that private clouds are run internally with a proprietary computing architecture that provides hosted services to a limited number of people behind a firewall. While [private cloud computing](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/private-cloud-computing/ "private cloud computing") may require more overhead expense when compared to public cloud computing, it does offer the organization more control over their data. 

#### Other advantages of Private Cloud Solutions: 

• **Elasticity:** Cloud computing environments can be scaled to meet your company’s ever-changing IT system requirement. 

• **Low capacity:** Pooling resources lets companies reduce computing capacity by giving higher-priority tasks more power during peak periods. 

**• Reduces overhead:** Servers and related resources can be managed as a unit 

**• Preparation:** Private clouds today can help companies prepare for the future of cloud computing services.

#### Benefits of Public Cloud Computing:

With public cloud computing, IT resources, like applications and data storage, are made available over the internet. When compared to private cloud options, [Public cloud solutions](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/public-cloud-computing/ "public cloud computing solutions") relieve the company of additional overhead and expenses. This, however, does come at the expense of losing some control. 

#### Other advantages of Public Cloud Solutions:

• Fast server provisioning by increasing service, storage and other computing needs   
• High redundancy, availability and reliability   
• All hardware applications and bandwidth are paid for by the provider   
• Scalable to meet individual or company needs, with public cloud users only paying for what they need. 

Invariably, the solution you choose comes down to your organization’s unique needs. To learn more about which [computing service](https://www.expedient.com/cloud-computing/) is right for you, contact Expedient today.
