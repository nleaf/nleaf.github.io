#### White Paper: Is It Time to Start Thinking About Exiting the Data Center Business? 

Companies make a choice to either redirect IT management functions to partners, or continue to maintain IT services internally, for a variety of reasons. From allowing staff to focus on what’s important to ensuring proper disaster recovery planning, turning to a third party provider typically begins with a business event that qualifies looking into alternative solutions for IT management. 

_David Hilmer, CIO at Graftech, reported “We recently had a power failure in the building that houses our data center and it took a full week to have the normal power to the building restored. We have a greater appreciation for what a data center disruption will do to our business, and we’ve determined that this is not the risk profile that we want to have.”_ 

Some businesses choose to partner with an outside provider for IT management, and some choose to keep IT management internal. While there are benefits and drawbacks to both, knowing where the benefits can outweigh the disadvantages in both scenarios can bring your business to the ideal decision. 

_“We have some very smart people in information technology services. What I would love to see happen as a benefit is to free them from the tyranny of the urgent, which is responding to outages around blinking lights, and spending all of their talents in trying to keep technology running.,” –Mark Henderson, CIO at Case Western University_
