Engineering a disaster recovery solution can be challenging. The widespread misconceptions about the subject don’t make things any easier. To bring clarity to the situation and help you choose a solution designed to meet your needs, Expedient has put together this list of top myths about disaster recovery.

#### Myth 1: Our Company Is Located in a Disaster Free Location

**_Point to Ponder:_** _70% of Downtime is Directly Related to Human Error1_ 

One of the most pervasive myths about [disaster recovery](https://www.expedient.com/managed-services/disaster-recovery/ "Disaster Recovery") relates to the assumption that most downtime is caused by Mother Nature (e.g. Hurricanes, Tornadoes, Flooding). The truth however is that most disasters, the ones that cause the most disruption, are man-made – meaning they can happen to anyone, anywhere and at any time. Regardless of whether you live in tornado alley, the hurricane ravished East Coast or some place a little tamer, creating a detailed disaster recovery solution is paramount to your company’s viability.

#### Myth 2: We Backup Our Data…We Should Be Safe

**_Point to Ponder:_** _Less than half of Small Businesses Backup their Data Weekly2_ 

First, it’s important to point out that most businesses don’t backup their data frequently enough for it to serve as an effective data recovery solution. However beyond this, it is also important to note that data backup is only one part of the disaster recovery solution. A full solution should include a detailed plan for failover and failback, as well as, ensuring continued access to your data and applications when the disaster occurs.

#### Myth 3: Disaster Recovery is Too Expensive

**_Point to Ponder:_** _40% of businesses who lost access to their data for a mere 24 hours went out of business. And when that interruption continued for more than ten days, 90% went out of business.3_ 

Too many businesses choose to forgo disaster recovery because they view it as an expensive luxury. But consider what happens if you don’t have access to your network or mission critical data. Are you willing to gamble away your company’s future because you are unwilling to allocate the necessary resources needed to build a viable [disaster recovery solution](/managed-services/disaster-recovery/ "Disaster Recovery as a Service")? The truth is that with the advancement of virtualization and virtual replication solutions, a disaster recovery solution that is designed to meet your needs is not out of reach and affordable.
