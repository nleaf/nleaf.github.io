## Data Center Security

Those seeking a dedicated cage environment with a hosting provider are sometimes under the false impression that caged floor space is more secure than other physical options. A common perception is that a dedicated cage environment provides an unparalleled level of security as well as the ability to meet auditing requirements; both viewpoints are not necessarily accurate. For this reason, it’s important to be aware of the features and benefits of all available physical security options before assuming a cage is the best and only option. Use cases for dedicated cage spaces can be difficult to define.

#### Shared racks

* Ideal for customers with minimal compute and storage needs.
* Secure and locked rack environment.
* Space is shared with another customer.

#### Half racks/full racks

* Half and full racks have the same features, except for space.
* Physically autonomous and segmented from other customers.
* Secure and accessible only by the customer.
* As an additional security feature, two-factor authentication is available for half and full racks, in addition to dedicated cages.
* Cameras can be installed in each cabinet to capture the image of the person opening the cabinet to record activity within the environment.
* Full racks may be a better choice for customers anticipating consistent growth.

#### Colocation Compliance Requirements

A common misconception, particularly among organizations with significant compliance requirements, is that housing an environment in a cage is a requisite. In reality, while audit requirements do entail physical security stipulations for securing data and hardware, nowhere within the audit mandates for HIPAA or PCI-DSS, for example, is there a specified requirement for a cage space. The requirement is actually for “strong access control.”
