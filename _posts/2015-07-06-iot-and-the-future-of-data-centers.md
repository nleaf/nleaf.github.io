## Will the IoT Mean More Data Centers?

The Internet of Things (IoT) is exploding! An estimated 35 billion devices serving 7 billion people will be connected to the Internet by 2020. That means a significant amount of data will be transferred, downloaded, uploaded, etc., every second of every day. Keeping with this workload will be a primary focus for data centers.

According to research published by the International Data Corp. (IDC), installed service provider data center capacity consumed by IoT workloads will increase nearly 750 percent between 2014 and 2019, which is a large jump in a short amount of time.

#### So how will this new demand affect the operations of managed hosting providers?

The IoT will spur companies to speed up their transition to the cloud as they will need to rely on the expertise, speed and agility that managed hosting providers are able to offer. These providers will need to stay at the forefront of developing technologies to deal with increased amounts of data as well as increased demand for speed.

With increased data traffic, risks rise as well, providing another reason that the IoT will increase the capacity of installed service operations in data centers by companies that need the security offered by secure cloud providers. Service providers will be expected to mitigate risks while still guaranteeing uptime, system availability and speed. Companies are likely to increase their use of backup servers and disaster recovery options in the data center facility as people continue to be more reliant on the IoT devices that they support and require them to always be available.

Expedient is ready to help with the expected IoT transitions to cloud computing or physical hosting environment. Expedient is able to augment your managed dedicated servers with the experience and knowledge of server management, including upgrades, fixes, monitoring, support and patching, so that you can focus on the core of your business. Another product offering from Expedient that will surely help with the IoT data explosion is [load balancing](https://www.expedient.com/managed-services/load-balancing/). Network and server load balancing allows for applications to use redundant servers preventing single points of failure and distributing traffic evenly. This can increase reliability and provide high availability, and scalability.
