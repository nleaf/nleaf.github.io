## On-Site Private Cloud

A lot of companies are looking to move away from higher capital expenses and switch over to utilizing more operational expenditures in order to budget for the ongoing costs more accurately. The utilization of Expedient’s On-Site Private Cloud with Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) allows companies to shift their IT hosting and cloud computing capabilities from CAPEX to OPEX while still controlling their entire environment. Enterprises can also use the Expedient On-Site Private Cloud as an entry point to scale up to the full Expedient Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud. Business can now get the outcome they need, on-demand, with greater agility, at a lower cost, and with less risk. 

The On-Site Private Cloud is a combination of the Expedient cloud and your own cloud. Basically, Expedient sets up hardware, virtualization appliances and the other elements of the On-Site Private Cloud inside your network. These resources are then continually upgraded for performance and capabilities to adjust with customers’ performance demands. In fact, with Expedient’s rapid refresh cycle, the resources of the Expedient On-Site Private Cloud are typically more powerful, more capable and more robust than the resources that make up a business’s own data center. 

For more information on how your company can benefit from having its own on-site private cloud or to learn more about the benefits of Expedient’s On-Site Private Cloud with DRaaS, [read the whitepaper](http://go.expedient.com/OSPC-DRaaS).
