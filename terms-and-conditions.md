## General Introduction

Continental Broadband Pennsylvania dba Expedient Data Centersand its affiliates (collectively, “Expedient”) have published these Terms and Conditions for Use of Service, (“TCUS”) in order to document the responsible use of Expedient’s networks, systems, services, Web site(s) and products (collectively, “Expedient Services”) by our customers, our customers’ employees, and other users of Expedient Services (collectively, “Users”).

PLEASE READ THIS TCUS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY EXPEDIENT SERVICES. BY USING ANY PART OF EXPEDIENT SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS TCUS AS SPECIFIED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY PART OF THIS TCUS, DO NOT USE ANY OF EXPEDIENT SERVICES.

You represent that you have read and agree to be bound by this TCUS, and that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. Expedient may revise this TCUS at any time by posting such revised TCUS to the Expedient Web site(s). Your continued use of Expedient Services means that you accept and agree to such revised TCUS. If you disagree with this TCUS (as revised from time to time), your sole remedy is to discontinue using Expedient Services. You should visit our web site at[https://www.expedient.com](https://www.expedient.com/) to review this TCUS often to be aware of any revisions.

## Lawful Use

Expedient Services may only be used for lawful purposes and consistent with all rights of other parties. Without limiting the foregoing, Expedient Services shall not be used in a manner which would violate any law or infringe any copyright, trademark, trade secret, right of publicity, privacy right or any other right of any person or entity or for the purpose of transmitting or storing of material which is obscene, libelous or defamatory. Use and access to other networks through Expedient must comply with the rules, regulations, terms, policies and/or conditions for such other networks. For purposes of tracking security breaches as well as general system administration, Users agree to be subject to random monitoring of activity while logged on to any Expedient Services.

No current or former User may use programs or methods intended to, or as a possible side-effect of their use, compromise the security of any system or device on our network or any external network, or attempt to bring about a denial of any form of service on our network or any external network.

## Web Commerce

User acknowledges that User’s use of Expedient Services, and all associated communications and transactions conducted on-line, may not be absolutely secure, and Expedient Services are not guaranteed to be error-free. By engaging in on-line activity, User accepts the responsibilities and risks associated with the use of the Internet generally. User understands that information available to User through the Internet may include materials that are unedited, explicit or offensive to User, and User’s access to such materials is at User’s own discretion and risk.

User further acknowledges that all transactions relating to merchandise or services offered by User through Expedient Services including, but not limited to, the purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery terms for such transactions are agreed to solely between User and third party purchasers. Expedient makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with respect to User’s goods and services, or with respect to the qualifications of any third party purchaser, and shall not be liable in any way to any such third party purchaser.

## Content Policies

### Harmful Content

User shall not use Expedient Services to transmit, distribute or store material that contains a virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other component harmful to Expedient Services, any other network or equipment, or other Users.

### Fraudulent Content

User shall not use Expedient Services to transmit or distribute material containing fraudulent offers for goods or services, or any advertising or promotional materials that contain false, deceptive, or misleading statements, claims, or representations. In addition, User is prohibited from submitting any false or inaccurate data on any order form, contract or online application, including the fraudulent use of credit cards.

### Mail & News Program Content

In order to maintain an efficient environment for the exchange of information and opinions, Expedient will not facilitate the transmission of harassing or mass unsolicited email in any form, and therefore such activity is strictly prohibited. Using or storing programs or methods designed to conceal the author’s identity by forging header information is also prohibited. User may use anonymous re-mailers so long as they are used legally and in accordance with the policies and procedures of Expedient set forth from time to time in Expedient’s sole discretion.

Using programs to collect email addresses from mailing lists, newsgroups or Web sites (“address harvesters” or “extractors”) is strictly prohibited. Additionally, the use of any form of bulk e-mailer system to deliver unsolicited mail in any amount is strictly prohibited. The use of “opt-out” mail distribution techniques is strictly prohibited. “Opt-out” techniques require User to do something not to receive future emails from a party it never originally requested to receive email from. This includes requiring User to send email to “remove” addresses in such cases. “Opt-in” lists, where User specifically elects to receive a party’s mailings, are permitted, provided ample proof exists that User actually elected to receive mail from such party.

Expedient does not restrict news postings on the basis of content with the exceptions that postings do not contain illegal information or otherwise violate this TCUS. Posting ten (10) or more separate copies of the same message (“spamming” or “excessive multi-posting”) or cross-posting a message to ten (10) or more newsgroups (“excessive cross-posting”) may also be prohibited. Should User violate these rules, User may be subject to additional charges for resources spent responding to complaints, deleting unsolicited correspondence and account cancellation.

Expedient may, but is not obligated to, block any incoming or outgoing email message that Expedient determines, in its sole discretion, is unsolicited or otherwise violates these terms. Expedient shall not be responsible for lost, misdirected, undeliverable or blocked email, whether in transmission or receipt.

Evidence that User is participating in any referenced prohibited activities may result in the immediate cancellation or suspension of User’s account in Expedient’s sole discretion. Furthermore, Expedient reserves the right to communicate information to User that it believes will enhance the benefits of the Expedient Services.

## Service Termination and Suspension

Expedient may, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend User’s account at any time to the extent that Expedient has reason to believe that User is acting in contravention of this TCUS noting that such termination or suspension does not release User from liability for any outstanding balance owed. User is responsible for any and all fees and costs (including, but not limited to, legal and court costs) required for collection of any such outstanding balance owed. Expedient may delete all data, files or other information that is stored in User’s account upon termination. Accounts suspended for nonpayment will be “held” for a thirty (30) calendar day period. During such thirty (30) calendar day suspension period, Expedient will preserve the assigned user name and account storage space. If payment has not been made within thirty (30) calendar days, Expedient may exercise its right to delete data files stored in User’s account. Once an account has been deleted, the username for that account becomes available to any new User. Furthermore, User will be obligated to pay all unpaid balances and an activation fee to have service reinstated.

## Use Of Expedient Materials

Materials contained in Expedient’s Web site(s) may be protected by national and international copyright and trademark laws. Except as expressly authorized by Expedient, User agrees not to copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit, or create derivative works from such materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, User may print or download one (1) copy of the materials on Expedient’s Web site(s) on any single computer for User’s personal, non-commercial use, provided User keeps intact all copyright and other proprietary notices which pertain to the material copied. Except as authorized in this paragraph, User is not being granted a license under any copyright, trademark, patent or other intellectual property right in the material or the products, services, processes or technology described therein. All such rights are retained by Expedient or any third party owner of such rights.

All Expedient names and logos and all related product and service names, service marks, trademarks, design marks and slogans are the property of Expedient (“Expedient Marks”). User is not authorized to display, copy, transmit, reproduce, modify or use any Expedient Mark in any manner without the prior written consent of Expedient. The Expedient Web site(s) may also contain other products, services and company names that may be the intellectual property of their respective owners.

## Miscellaneous Provisions

### IP Addresses

IP addresses are not portable and are not assigned for independent administration or distribution. User understands that IP assignments are not guaranteed and may be modified as required by Expedient and/or the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN).

### Servers

User agrees that any servers used in conjunction with its service will be patched and free of any and all vendor published vulnerabilities that could cause or contribute to a denial of service situation. Failure to do so may result in the termination or suspension of services as deemed to be harmful to other customers by Expedient.

### Non-Solicitation

User agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit the trade of, or trade with, any other User for a business purpose that would compete with any of the Expedient Services where such solicitation is made possible only through the use of information gained by virtue of being an Expedient customer.

### Changes to Service

The Expedient Services are expected to change from time to time as technology changes and systems are upgraded. Expedient reserves the right to change any service offered or the features of any service offered on its network without notice, including changes to access and use procedures and all system hardware and software.

Users are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of Expedient Services, including, without limitation, (a) accessing data not intended for such User or logging into a server or account which such User is not authorized to access, (b) impersonating Expedient personnel, (c) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization, (d) attempting to interfere with, disrupt or disable service to any User, host or network, including, without limitation, via means of overloading, “flooding”, “mailbombing”, “denial of service” attacks or “crashing”, (e) forging any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any e-mail or newsgroup posting, (f) taking any action in order to obtain services to which such User is not entitled, or (g) attempting to utilize another User’s account name or persona without authorization from that User. Users are also prohibited from attempting any action designed to circumvent or alter any method of measuring or billing for Expedient Services. Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability. Expedient will investigate occurrences, which may involve such violations and may involve, and cooperate with, law enforcement authorities in prosecuting Users who are involved in such violations.

### Violations

User understands that Expedient employs an abuse interface to monitor and manage reported violations of this TCUS, system or network security, any law or regulation, or other network abuses and that Expedient may notify User of any reported violations by User. Use of Expedient Services constitutes consent to monitoring. If User is suspected of hacking or violating network security, User may be subject to criminal and civil liability. Expedient will investigate incidents involving such violations and may involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities if a criminal violation is suspected.

### Suspension; Termination; Access Restriction

User agrees that any violation of this TCUS may result in suspension or termination of Expedient Services, without notice, at Expedient’s sole option. User agrees that Expedient shall not be liable for any damages of any nature suffered by User or any third party resulting in whole or in part from Expedient’s exercise of its rights under this TCUS. User further agrees that Expedient may terminate User’s service if any law enforcement agency, acting within its jurisdiction, advises that Expedient Services are being used in violation of the law.

Expedient reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate User’s access to any or all Expedient Web site(s) and the related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice.
