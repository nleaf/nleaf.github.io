**Medford, MA (May 9, 2016)** —Protecting critical applications and data from downtime isn’t as complicated as it once was thanks to disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) solutions. Expedient has partnered with Zerto—for each of the past four (4) years—to combine its DRaaS Host-to-Host Replication service with other complementary products that enable business continuity plans between off-site locations and one or more of its eleven (11) data centers. 

As a Silver sponsor at this year’s [ZertoCON](http://www.zerto.com/zertocon/), Expedient will have an exhibit hall presence at the event, which will include a variety of speakers from organizations including Gartner, Forrester and NASA. Educational sessions covering the technologies and strategies associated with business continuity and disaster recovery planning will be featured throughout the event and a hands-on lab that will give attendees the full Zerto Virtual Replication experience. Expedient plans to publish a recorded demonstration of its Host-to-Host Replication service (powered by Zerto Virtual Replication) on its web site for interested individuals who are unable to attend. 

Expedient currently has more than thirty (30) Zerto Certified Professionals (ZCP) among its technical teams supporting clients in a variety of industries including healthcare, finance, eCommerce/Retail and professional services across the United States. Its expertise with disaster recovery solutions in public and private clouds—that are aligned with industry and government compliance mandates—resulted in its appointment to the Zerto Partner Advisory Council.
