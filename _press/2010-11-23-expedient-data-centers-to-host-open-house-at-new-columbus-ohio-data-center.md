(Columbus, Ohio) November 23, 2010 Expedient Data Centers, a leading provider of colocation, managed services and connectivity announced they will be hosting the Grand Opening of their Columbus data center on December 9th, 2010. The Open House will be from 11:00am to 5:00pm.

The new facility, located at 5000 Arlington Center Blvd in Upper Arlington, OH, is Expedient's first data center in the Columbus area and their eighth data center in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Other data centers are located in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Baltimore and Boston. The new Columbus Data Center will have top-tier systems including dual commercial power feeds, redundant generators, N+2 cooling systems, multi-carrier telecommunications infrastructure, multiple-tiered security system, two fire suppression systems, and a fully-staffed Operations Support Center (OSC).

Members of the Expedient executive management team will be on hand to greet visitors, give tours, answer questions and generally introduce Expedient's plans for its Columbus Service offerings. Software Systems, Network and Electrical Facility Engineers will also be on-site to provide technical overviews and to answer specific questions from the IT/IS community.

"It isn't often that an enterprise class data center is open for public tours," said Bryan Smith, Expedient's General Manager in Columbus," in fact, this is the first time we have ever extended an open, public invitation to tour one of our data centers." The facility preview is only available this one time, as part of Expedient's initial launch into the Columbus market. "We are scheduled to begin installing client solutions on January 2nd, when of course, full security measures will be in effect, which would make an open event impossible," explained Smith.

Expedient is expanding its position in the Data Center/Managed Service Hosting Industry, and this new facility will help meet the demand for hosting services in central Ohio. By providing these services, Expedient enables its commercial customers to focus on their business's critical applications and not worry about the environment where they are housed and safeguarded.
