**Pittsburgh, PA (27 August 2018) –** Expedient, an infrastructure as a service and cloud services provider, today announced it will provide customers a managed services offering for VMware Cloud on AWS and has contracted as a VMware Cloud Provider Program MSP partner for this offering. VMware Cloud on AWS delivers VMware’s software-defined data center (SDDC) via the AWS Cloud, allowing customers to run applications across operationally consistent VMware vSphere-based private, public, and hybrid cloud environments, with optimized access to a broad range of AWS services.

The VMware Cloud Provider Program MSP model is for partners that offer managed services and consulting services, and includes tools, training, and expertise required for partners to develop and deliver managed services for VMware Cloud on AWS.

With its VMware Cloud on AWS offering and its adoption of VMware SDDC, Expedient is poised to provide to its customers the breadth of AWS services paired seamlessly with private clouds managed by Expedient.

“Our managed services offering for VMware Cloud on AWS is a significant evolution for managed private clouds,” said John White, Expedient’s Vice President of Product Strategy. “Expedient is now delivering on a vision of software-defined data centers to streamline virtualization management and provide scale for growth.”

Public clouds enable customers to gain flexibility and speed to respond to changing business needs, accelerate innovation, and align costs to business requirements. Customers are also recognizing the benefit of having public clouds integrate and work seamlessly with on-premises infrastructure to take advantage of existing teams, skill sets, tools and processes.

VMware Cloud on AWS enables customers to add value to their business in the AWS cloud, while maximizing their VMware investments, without the need to buy new hardware, or refactor applications.

Enterprise customers can work with partners such as Expedient to be their trusted advisors as they move towards the emerging hybrid cloud model. Expedient brings industry and technical expertise to customers to help them quickly execute on their digital transformation initiatives using VMware Cloud on AWS.

“We are pleased to see Expedient deliver a managed services offering for VMware Cloud on AWS. With this, Expedient can help customers accelerate cloud adoption and migration, modernize their data center environments and increase IT efficiency,” said Geoff Thompson, senior director, service provider programs, VMware. “VMware Cloud on AWS provides a full VMware-based software-defined data center experience extending from customers’ on-premises environment to AWS, the world’s largest public cloud. The solution enables customers to eliminate operational complexity by managing a hybrid cloud environment with familiar VMware tools.”
