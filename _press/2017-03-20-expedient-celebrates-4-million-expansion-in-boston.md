**Pittsburgh, PA (20 March 2017) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced the completion and opening of a $4 million renovation and expansion of its Boston data center. 

Expedient has operated the data center, located just outside Boston in Medford, MA, for more than 10 years. The facility was operating at nearly full capacity prior to this year’s expansion project, which adds 8,000 square feet of new raised floor computer room space and cloud capacity for IaaS and disaster recovery as a service (DRaas) solutions. 

In addition to the expansion, a total renovation of the facility’s lobby, conference room, Operations Support Center (OSC), and office space was also completed. The renovation combines design with function, and establishes a refreshed look and consistency with Expedient’s 10 other data center facilities in the Midwest and East Coast. 

Located at 1 Cabot Road across from the MBTA’s Wellington Station, the data center facility includes all Expedient services from physical server colocation to public, private cloud and a suite of managed IT infrastructure services, along with 24x7x365 on-site support. The facility is connected to Expedient’s 10 other data centers in six cities through a minimum 10Gbps private fiber backbone, creating a powerful distributed presence for critical IT infrastructure services. And, like all of Expedient’s data centers, the facility offers SOC 1 (SSAE-18) and SOC 2 audit attestations, and supports customers’ needs to meet PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and other industry/regulatory standards. 

“This expansion allows us to continue to serve Boston and beyond with our state-of-the-art facility, including our on-site performance cloud point of delivery,” said Curtis DePass, Regional Vice President for the Northeast at Expedient. “And, with our Boston data center’s multi-gigabit connectivity to our 10 other facilities, we are uniquely positioned to offer this region seamless out-of-market, offsite hosting capabilities.” 

Open house events will run Tuesday, March 28 through Friday, March 31 with some of Boston’s favorite food trucks providing lunch and snacks throughout the week. Expedient will also be hosting key members of its vendor partner technology team on site, including Zerto (Virtual Machine Host Replication), VMware (Hypervisor and Storage Replication), Commvault (Backups), and more. Those interested in touring the facility can register at expedient.com/bostonopenhouse; advance registration and valid government-issued photo identification are required for access.
