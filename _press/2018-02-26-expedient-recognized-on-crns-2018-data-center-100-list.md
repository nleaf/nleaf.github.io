**Pittsburgh, PA. (26 February 2018)** **–** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced that [CRN**®**](http://www.crn.com), a brand of [The Channel Company](http://www.thechannelco.com/), has named Expedient to its 2018 Data Center 100 list. This annual list recognizes technology suppliers that excel at powering, supporting and protecting the complex and demanding data centers on which today’s businesses rely.

CRN editors select companies for the Data Center 100 list on the basis of multiple criteria, including each company’s overall impact on the market, its influence on the channel as a whole, and the types of technology and services it makes available to its partners.

In addition to recognizing technology suppliers for outstanding products and services, the Data Center 100 serves as a valuable guide for solution providers looking for best-in-class vendors providing data center infrastructure, data center management tools, software-defined data center technology and data center services.

Expedient’s sixth consecutive appearance on the Data Center 100 list is attributable to its 11 state-of-the-art data center facilities in Boston, Baltimore (2), Cleveland (2), Columbus (2), Indianapolis, Memphis, and Pittsburgh (2), and to its leading-edge developments in managed services, including its Push Button DR solution, which leverages software-defined networking to enable seamless entire-network failover from one location to another with a single push of a button.

“CRN’s Data Center 100 vendors are aptly recognized for their best-in-class technologies and services, which enable solution providers to drive greater innovation, efficiency and profit in the data center,” said Bob Skelley, CEO, The Channel Company. “The 2018 list identifies the current top vendors in this vital market, helping solution providers find proven data center experts who can deliver the depth and breadth of materials, services and expert guidance required to meet their customers’ needs.”

“We’re honored to once again be recognized on the CRN Data Center 100 list,” said Shawn McGorry, President and Chief Operating Officer of Expedient. “2017 was a year of growth and expansion for Expedient. Our Boston, Indianapolis, and Pittsburgh – Nova Place data centers were each renovated and expanded, and we enjoyed double-digit growth in our managed services, including our disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) solutions. Continued recognition like this from CRN affirms our investments in our data center facilities and IaaS solutions.”
