(Pittsburgh, PA) October 30, 2012, Expedient, leading provider of colocation, cloud computing, managed hosting services and connectivity has kicked-off the engineering and investment in a significant expansion of their second Pittsburgh data center within Allegheny Center Mall (ACM), which was originally opened in September of 2008.

This project will double the amount of production ready, raised floor space at Expedient's 2nd Pittsburgh data center and will expand the current facility to a total of 18,000 square feet of computing space and 25,000 square feet overall. This is Expedient's third data center expansion in Pittsburgh since 2008. "We are pleased with the accelerating demand for our private cloud and colocation services in the Pittsburgh market and we look forward to the opportunities that our expansion projects will provide to our current and future customers," states Shawn McGorry, President and COO of Expedient.

Expedient has kicked-off the engineering study and purchase of long lead time items to build out the new 8,000 sq. ft. raised floor space which will be contiguous to their current data center and will be a six month, multi-million dollar project. Expedient currently operates in six cities including Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Columbus, Baltimore and Boston. The expansion space will be immediately accessible to Expedient's multi-city network of data centers via connection to a fully redundant 10Gig fiber backbone. Expedient's new data center footprint will provide companies with the ideal environment for economically hosting their business critical applications, enabling them to increase the availability of their companies' data. It will also house Expedient's 4th generation of cloud computing/virtual hosting pods; each pod has over 3,000GB of memory that can be allocated to customers in 1GB increments. "This expansion is being built in response to the region's demand for cost-effective and reliable IT outsourcing solutions, and guided by input from customers into our unique mix of products and services", McGorry comments.

Once the expansion has been completed the Pittsburgh ACM Data Center will have top tier features including 18,000 sq. ft. of raised floor, dual power feeds, two 2,200KW Caterpillar generators, four UPS systems, 500 tons of cooling, diverse telecommunications fiber infrastructure, multi-tiered security system, FE25 fire suppression and VESDA fire detection system and a fully staffed 24x7x365 Operations Support Center (OSC).

"We expect next year will be a continuation of our record growth year in 2012. Much of our success in Pittsburgh is attributed to being headquartered here and having many talented people who have become part of the local technology community", McGorry states. "While many believe that cloud computing and managed hosting services are not normally associated with a particular physical location, Expedient provides an excellent customer experience through a personal touch along with local, top tier Data Centers."
