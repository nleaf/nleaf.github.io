Pittsburgh, Pa. - February 26, 2007 -Â Expedient Data Centers has acquired the 25,000 square foot Boston data center and the colocation services business of Safecore Datacenter Services, LLC a subsidiary of Safecore, Inc. The data center space will augment Expedient's existing fiber optic network in Boston and offer local businesses there the same sophisticated managed and hosted solutions it now offers in other markets.

Safecore will remain as a customer of the datacenter and continue to provide Digital Archiving services for regulatory compliance, litigation support and life cycle management. "This transaction was a strategic step for Safecore which allows the Company to focus on its core Digital Archiving business, and to expand by leveraging Expedient's numerous datacenters and extensive network, which is perfect for the movement of large data files for archiving", said Stephen Catanzano, CEO, Safecore.

The name of the Data Center services will be changed to Expedient effective immediately. All of the Safecore employees providing technical support and facility oversight have been hired by Expedient. Over the course of the next few weeks, Expedient anticipates making additional hires to support a growing customer base served from this new Boston facility.

Shawn McGorry, president of Expedient Data Centers, explains why the acquisition is important to the company. "We believe that it gives us the leverage and depth of product offering to be a real player in the Boston technology market. Also, it adds another market to our network of providers. With each acquisition, customers benefit from the growing strength of this collective network."

This transaction follows Expedient's November 2006 merger of ANET Internet Services into its network. As part of Continental Broadband, Expedient can offer its customers solutions using similar data centers in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Richmond, Indianapolis and South Florida.

McGorry also said the acquisition has augmented Expedient's client roster. "A large majority of Safecore's customers are traditional co-location customers; they're purchasing power, bandwidth and environmental oversight. Expedient will bring a breadth of connectivity and managed service offerings to these customers that will add value to their existing experience."
