**Pittsburgh, PA (December 2, 2015)** — Expedient, a provider of information technology cloud infrastructure services, successfully earned an Attestation of Compliance (AOC) for its Report on Compliance (ROC), in support of hosted client credit card data environments. Validation of compliance and publication of this documentation is conducted annually pursuant to the PCI DSS standard. 

Issued by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), the ROC provides evidence for clients and prospects as to the effectiveness of operating controls in place to safeguard cardholder data environments (CDE). Additionally, the company’s recent listing on the Visa Global Registry—a public directory of compliant service providers worldwide—affirms a commitment to the pursuit of operational excellence conveying trust and confidence to existing clients and prospects. 

From managed firewall and two factor authentication service to network segmentation and least privilege access, Expedient creates tailored solutions that fit the needs of its clients. “We offer compliance attestation documentation that is complementary to a broad range of industry and government compliance mandates. Our team is pleased to have earned this most recent validation for PCI DSS,” said Jonathan H. Rosenson, Vice President of Quality Assurance and Strategic Initiatives. 

Cardholder data security is a critical consideration for businesses that accept payment card transactions. The PCI DSS is a standard framework that includes best practices surrounding twelve areas of requirements related to policies, procedures and technical considerations that service providers must follow in order to safeguard cardholder data. 

The PCI DSS, which was created in partnership by the credit card brands including American Express, Discover, JCB, Mastercard and Visa, treats safeguarding cardholder data as a shared responsibility among merchants, banks and service providers. As a trusted advisor to its merchant clients, Expedient delivers computing environments with logical processes and procedures that complement hosted application compliance.
