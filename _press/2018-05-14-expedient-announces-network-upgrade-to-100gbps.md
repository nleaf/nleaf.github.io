**Pittsburgh, PA (14 May 2018)** **–** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, announced the upgrade of its network backbone to enable 100Gbp/s speed connectivity across multiple Expedient data center locations and carrier neutral points of presence (POPs) used for IP transit and peering interconnection.

The project represents a more than $1.8 million infrastructure investment and is driven by increased customer demand for solutions that require data replication, including Expedient’s Push Button DR. Expedient recently announced the year-over-year doubling of disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) revenues.

Design work for the physical fiber upgrade began nearly a year ago, and all segments will be complete by July 2018. Once finished, the expansion will increase Expedient’s network backbone capacity by 10 times, and facilitate highly redundant connectivity between Expedient data centers as well as to hyperscale cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

Included in the upgrade is the commissioning of new Juniper Networks MX Series Universal Edge Routers, which will provide advanced broadband network gateway functions and integrated routing, switching, and security services. The platform offers versatility for high-level routing and basic switching in addition to an array of automation features built into Junos, including integration with VMware NSX software defined networking (SDN), in support of multi-cloud communication requirements.

“Using Juniper Networks breadth of products allows Expedient to expand their offerings to customers, facilitating their migration to secure and automated multi-cloud environments. Together, Juniper and Expedient are helping customers tackle the day-to-day complexities that they face, with the ultimate goal being the promise of building infrastructure that is largely invisible to users,” said Michael Bushong, Vice President of Enterprise and Cloud Marketing, Juniper Networks.

“The investment we’ve made in upgrading our fiber backbone reflects our commitment to our customers’ businesses and their increasingly complex networking and connectivity needs,” said Dan Pregman, Director of Network Planning and Architecture. “Our 100Gbp/s network will provide customers with unparalleled redundancy and support for their data replication and cloud connectivity needs.”
