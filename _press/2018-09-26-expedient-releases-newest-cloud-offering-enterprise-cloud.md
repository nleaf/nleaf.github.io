**Pittsburgh, PA (26 September 2018) –** Expedient, an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and cloud services provider, today announced the release of its newest cloud offering, Expedient Enterprise Cloud.

Expedient Enterprise Cloud, which consists of a full VMware stack of products – including VMware vCloud Director®, VMware NSX®, VMware vSAN, and the VMware vRealize® Suite – provides a single ecosystem that simplifies management, monitoring, and support of cloud environments. Embedded functionalities like Encryption at Rest and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) help to ensure compliance with rigorous security needs, while a single, easy-to-use interface streamlines access to the cloud and visibility across cloud resources.

The release is the culmination of thousands of hours in education, certifications, design sessions, and beta testing over the past several years, according to John White, Vice President of Product Strategy for Expedient.

“The release of Expedient Enterprise Cloud is a milestone in our vision of hardware-redundant clouds available anywhere – in one of our data centers, a partner data center, or an on-premises customer location – all equipped to provide a low-latency, highly-performant cloud for all critical applications,” said White.

Enterprise Cloud furthers Expedient’s multi-cloud roadmap and comes on the heels of product releases including:

* Nutanix as a Service: The full suite of Expedient managed services available for Nutanix Cloud Platform
* Multi-Cloud Connection: Enabling bi-directional, secure connectivity between Expedient data centers and hyperscale clouds such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services
* VMware Cloud on AWS: IaaS and DRaaS solutions powered by VMware and available from an Expedient data center or in VMware Cloud on AWS
