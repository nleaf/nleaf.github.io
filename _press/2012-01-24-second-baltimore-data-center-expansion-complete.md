[Second Baltimore Data Center Expansion Complete (PDF)](https://www.expedient.com/Baltimore_Expansion_2_Complete.pdf)

(Baltimore, Maryland) January 19, 2012 - Expedient, leading provider of colocation, managed services and connectivity, announced today they have completed their second state of the art data center at their Tide Point campus.

The new 10,000 sq. ft. facility is contiguous to their current data center and was a seven month, multi-million dollar project.  Expedient currently operates in six cities including Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Columbus, and Boston.   Expedient’s new data center provides companies from the greater Baltimore region with the ideal environment for economically hosting their business critical applications, enabling them to increase the availability of their companies’ data.   “With the deployment of our more advanced product suites, particularly in the Cloud-Virtual and Managed Services applications, we have expanded dramatically to serve our growing customer base.  Our second data center was built in response to the region’s appetite for more cost-effective and reliable IT outsourcing solutions, and driven by customer demand for our specific products and services”, Bryan Smith, Regional Vice President, Expedient, states.

Expedient continues to be the leader in managed hosting and the largest data center company in the Greater Baltimore region.  The new facility provides them with the capacity to meet the demand for high quality data center space in Baltimore and is designed as a platform for their managed service offerings.  These services allow the customer to focus on their business critical applications and not have to worry about the cost of building and maintaining the infrastructure that houses their IT environment.

The second [Baltimore Data Center ](https://www.expedient.com/data-centers/baltimore-data-center-tide-point/)has top tier features including 5,500 sq. ft. of raised floor, dual power feeds, redundant 800KW Caterpillar generators, upgrades to 410 tons of cooling with 8 new CRAC units, multi carrier telecommunications infrastructure, multi-tiered security system, FE25 fire suppression system and a fully staffed 24x7x365 Operations Support Center (OSC).

“Companies can benefit from working with an organization such as ours because we give them access to an extremely robust and reliable computing environment that is not economically feasible for most companies to build on their own”, Smith comments.  “All Expedient data centers have engineers onsite 24x7x365 to assist customers with any of their technical needs, which further increases the security and availability of their data cost-effectively, which is the ultimate goal.”
