(Cleveland, OH.) October 10, 2011 - Expedient Data Centers, Cleveland’s premier [managed hosting provider](https://www.expedient.com/) and the region’s largest data center company announced today the completion of a power plant upgrade project at their original Garfield Heights data center and the start of their expansion project to double the size of their 2nd data center within the Cleveland area. In January 2011, Expedient announced an expansion and upgrade plan for all 6 of their markets with Cleveland beginning first. These multi‐million dollar upgrades expanded on previous investments in raised floor space, infrastructure and related power and cooling capacities of Expedient’s eight data centers to meet client demand for additional resources.

“We intend to be the thoughtful and take a leadership role when it comes to implementing state of the art data centers that deliver 100% uptime and protect clients’ critical data housed within our managed hosting platforms,” stated Bryan Smith, Regional Vice President.

The $2 Million Dollar upgrade to the [NEO 151 data center](https://www.expedient.com/data-centers/cleveland-neo-151-data-center/) in Cleveland was completed in order to meet the power capacity demands of the growing customer base within Expedient’s original Cleveland Data Center. The NEO 151 data center now has two new 1.5 megawatt generators, two additional 500kVA Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) systems and two additional automatic transfer switches (ATS). The NEO 151 Data Center now has more than 1,600kVa of end to end capacity, configured in a redundant, A and B side power plant serving the critical load on the Data Center floor.

In addition to the NEO 151expansion, Expedient has kicked‐off the expansion of their[ NEO 152 data center](https://www.expedient.com/data-centers/cleveland-neo-152-data-center/) within NEO Park which was originally opened in October of 2009. This project will double the amount of data processing space at Expedient’s 2nd Cleveland data center and will expand the current facility to a total of 21,000 square feet. It will be Expedient’s sixth data center expansion in Cleveland since 2006 and is slated for completion in Q2 2012. “We are pleased with the accelerating demand for cloud and colocation services in the Cleveland market and we look forward to the opportunities that our expansion projects will provide to our valued clients,” Smith commented.
