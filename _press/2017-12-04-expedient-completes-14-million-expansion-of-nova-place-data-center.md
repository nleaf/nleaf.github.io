**Pittsburgh, PA (4 December 2017) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced the completion of a $14 million expansion of its Nova Place data center in Pittsburgh. 

The expansion adds 10,000 square feet of new raised floor computer room space and cloud capacity for IaaS and disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) solutions. Several thousand additional square feet have been dedicated to fully redundant switchgear, Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems, and emergency generators with up to two megawatts of demand and fuel capacity. Additionally, the renovated and expanded facility is powered by new dedicated and redundant commercial utility power service. 

Official grand opening celebrations for the expansion are slated for late January 2018, but Expedient welcomed the Pittsburgh Technology Council’s TechVibe Radio show for a two-show recording in late November. Among the guests for the radio shows were economic development leaders focused on the continued resurgence of Pittsburgh’s North Side, where the Nova Place data center is located; the shows will air in December. 

The Nova Place data center is one of two Expedient data centers in the Pittsburgh region. Its expansion marks Expedient’s third such undertaking in Pittsburgh in 14 years, and was one of the company’s three major expansion projects this year, which included an 8,000-square-foot expansion and renovation of Expedient’s Boston data center that was completed in March 2017 and a $4.5 million upgrade of its Indianapolis data center that, like Nova Place, was completed in November. 

“The significant investment we have made in our Nova Place data center well-positions us as the region’s leading provider of IaaS and cloud solutions, and demonstrates our commitment to providing leading-edge technical solutions to our customers,” said David Saliba, Regional Vice President for Expedient. 

Like all Expedient data centers, Nova Place offers all Expedient services from physical server colocation to public and private cloud infrastructure, and a suite of managed IT infrastructure services, along with 24x7x365 on-site support. All Expedient data centers are connected through Layer 2 network access and a multi-gigabit private fiber backbone, creating a powerful distributed presence for critical IT infrastructure services. And, all Expedient data centers offer SOC 1 (SSAE-18) and SOC 2 audit attestations, and support customers’ needs to meet PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and other industry/regulatory compliance mandates.
