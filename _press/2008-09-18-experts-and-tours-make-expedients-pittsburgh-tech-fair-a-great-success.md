### Experts and Tours Make Expedient's Pittsburgh Tech Fair a Great Success

Expedient held its annual Pittsburgh Tech Fair on September 18, 2008. More than 170 participants started the day with breakfast at Expedient's new Pittsburgh Data Center (at 1 Allegheny Center Mall). This facility is the 9th Data Center operated by Expedient. After breakfast attendees enjoyed two presentations, one by Jeanne Morain from VMWare and one by Chris Rauch from EMC2.

Participants were then able to tour the data center while guides participated in question and answer sessions. Following the event, participants headed to the Pirates game where they enjoyed the game as well as lunch while watching the Pirates play the Dodgers.

The addition of Expedient's Allegheny Center facility was announced in May as one of two recently completed growth projects. The expansion increased the company's data center space by 24,000 sq. ft. Additionally, this facility will be included in Expedient's annual SAS70 audit to ensure it meets the commitment of providing premium service and following best practices as with Expedient's other existing data centers.

Participants lined up to find out more about Expedient's capabilities and experience the data center improvements first-hand via guided tours. The event culminated in lunch at the Pirates game.
