Company launches new services; names new Regional Account Manager.

(ERIE, PA - SEPTEMBER 30, 2004) -Â Expedient announced today that it has begun to offer Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to its existing and new Commercial Internet Service customers in the Erie market. VoIP, sometimes referred to as "internet voice" is a technology that allows the placement of telephone calls using a broadband internet connection.

Expedient, which acquired the Commercial Services Business of the former Stargate.net last October, has already launched its VoIP service offerings in four other markets, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Miami and Boston. "So far, our clients have been pleasantly surprised with both the cost savings and the quality of the voice products we've rolled out," said Shawn McGorry, Expedient's President. The company is currently offering Dedicated Long Distance, 800 number service, and a unique Phone Conferencing application, under its Voice Services umbrella. Expedient will release Switched Long Distance and 800 service before year's end, with plans to aggressively expand its voice portfolio in 2005.

VoIP is emerging as a cost-effective alternative to traditional telephone service. VoIP calls bypass much if not all of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) by sending them through the more efficient internet connections. VoIP is also not subject to stringent regulations and excise fees that are applied to the telephone services that are facilitated by the conventional telecommunications providers.

"Our large base of Commercial Internet Service Clients enables us to immediately demonstrate the cost benefits of VoIP, in many cases without the need for additional equipment or service interruption," stated McGorry. "Our Nationwide Network has access to the best carriers in the world, which allows Expedient to offer this service at prices that will provide our customers significant savings." he added.

### New Regional Account Manager Named

Expedient introduced Thomas Duska, a life long Erie Sales and Marketing Professional as its new Regional Account Manager. Tom will be charged, not only with the VoIP roll out, but also with new Business Development and Relationship Management for all of Northwest Pennsylvania. Prior to joining Expedient, Mr. Duska worked for Verizon as a National Accounts Manager. "We are delighted to have someone of Tom's experience, character and integrity on our team. I'm looking forward to the great things he will do for Expedient and the business community in Erie," stated Bryan Smith, National Vice President of Sales for Expedient.

### New Product Bundles

Expedient has been able to leverage a multitude of carrier relationships to drive down the cost of local telecommunications transport and internet bandwidth. Together with their VoIP offerings, they will begin rolling out service packages that will allow Commercial customers to get data transport, internet service, enhanced IP features like VPN and VoIP from a single provider, all on one bill. "In today's high-speed world, our cust."
