[![dublin1](/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dublin1-1024x263.png)](https://www.expedient.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dublin1.png)[](https://www.expedient.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dublin_render_ext.jpg)(Columbus, Ohio) September 8, 2014 – Expedient Data Centers, a leading provider of colocation, cloud computing, managed hosting and internet related connectivity services, has announced the groundbreaking of the first phase of a new 60,000 sq. ft. data center in Dublin, Ohio. The addition of the new Dublin data center facility, comes on the heels of Expedient’s 2013 expansion at its Upper Arlington Data Center, which opened in 2011. Expedient officials cite brisk market response at the recently opened Upper Arlington facility and a continually strengthening relationship with the Columbus technology community as the primary drivers for its latest investment. “The site selection process was incredibly thorough” said Bryan Smith, Expedient’s Regional Vice President. “We were fortunate to secure a location which is directly adjacent to an electrical substation, which in our business, equates to enhanced availability to a reliable power source. There are also fourteen fiber optic telecommunications/data-transport providers physically present at the property, which will give our customers a variety of options for data transport diversity,” added Smith. City of Dublin Director of Development, Dana McDaniel, said; “Expedient’s announcement to expand in the City of Dublin is a clear indication of our growing ability to meet not only business demands for reliable infrastructure, but also for access to a highly qualified workforce needed to support the new technologies hosted within these facilities.” “This is clearly a win for all information technology companies in central Ohio, with the establishment of another local outlet aimed at meeting their growing demands for reliable and convenient data center hosting solutions,” added McDaniel. According to Smith, the new data center in Dublin will ultimately triple Expedient’s footprint in the Columbus market and at the same time, will make Expedient the region’s only data center provider capable of offering both in-market geographic diversity and seamless out-of-market, off-site hosting alternatives. This new facility, along with Expedient’s other 2014 expansions, will bring Expedient’s 10 data center production capacity to a total of 275,000 square feet from which over 1,400 business customers are served. Smith said this is a “ground-up” build investment and the cost of the initial phase, which represents about one third of the total data center capacity, will exceed $22 million dollars. The first computing room will be 15,000 square feet of production space which will support 575 standard cabinets of computing equipment. Once all three computing rooms are fully built out, the total investment is projected to exceed $52 million dollars. Prior to the Grand Opening, currently slated for mid-late 2015, Expedient will be deploying security, power and HVAC infrastructure to meet its rigid service standards, including full, end to end redundancy on every critical element of the facility infrastructure. “In just a few short years since coming to Columbus in 2011, the market has become core to our business strategy,” explained Shawn McGorry, Expedient President and COO.   “Thanks to the support of our customers, the great partnerships we’ve enjoyed in the community and of course, the hard work of our employees, we are delighted to expand our commitment to the mid-Ohio region. We are dedicated to earn and re-earn again, our position of trusted advisor for outsourced IT infrastructure and cloud computing solutions in all the markets we serve.” Features of the new, Dublin Data Center include 15,000 square feet of 36” raised floor space, dual power feeds, four 800 kW Liebert UPS systems, 450 tons of cooling, two Caterpillar diesel generators with 4.4MW capacity and completely diverse telecom entrances. The facility is also designed for customers that require the highest level of security. Like all of Expedient’s data centers, the facility will be staffed 24x7x365 with live, local technical support, it will meet SSAE18, SOC I and SOC II audit requirements and will support our customer’s needs to meet PCI-DSS, HIPAA and other industry/regulatory standards. The company expects to add about fifteen (15) technical support and IT engineer type positions in the near term, coinciding with the new facility opening. “We have engineered this facility to provide the ideal environment for a mid-sized company that is looking for space for a few racks or for the large enterprise that is looking for a private suite that can act as their own data center,” stated Smith. The facility will be the Expedient’s tenth (10th) data center, all of which are seamlessly connected facilities, over a fully redundant, 10Gb Fiber network. Expedient’s other data centers are located in Pittsburgh (2), Cleveland (2), Columbus, Baltimore (2), Boston and Indianapolis. The company is adding more data center capacity in Cleveland, Indianapolis, and Boston, with significant expansion to those facilities already underway. **More** **about Expedient** In addition to traditional data center colocation services, Expedient is known for offering a wide range of managed services such as virtualization, cloud computing, remote backups, management of equipment, storage area networks and more.
