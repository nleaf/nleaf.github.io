24,000 sq. ft. of Additional Data Center Space and 10Gbps Network Access Increase Expedient's Presence in the Pittsburgh Market

Pittsburgh, Pa. - May 9, 2008 -Â Expedient Data Centers, a leading provider of data center colocation and managed solutions for local business customers in Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Boston, has finalized plans to expand into Pittsburgh's Allegheny Center Mall complex. The move will add an additional 24,000 sq. ft. of data center space and state-of-the art, power, cooling and network facilities to the growing company.

This is the second expansion announcement from Expedient in less than 90 days. In February, Expedient also announced its expansion of its Cleveland data center.

The new Pittsburgh data center will be connected to Cleveland and other data centers around the country via multi-Gbps, long-haul fiber optic network. This provides direct access to multiple tier 1 providers, a high availability network including firewalls and load balancers. In addition, there will be on-site engineers and a Network Operating Center (OSC) to provide premier support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This facility will be included in Expedient's annual SSAE-18 audit to ensure it meets the commitment of providing premium service and following best practices as with Expedient's other existing data centers.

Expedient President Shawn McGorry said the investment supports the tide of new customers at Expedient that bundle its network access expertise with its solid and reliable data center solutions. "This past year we've experienced a lot of organic growth - our customers are expanding their services and other companies in the area are noticing the differences between us and our competition. Our focus will continue to be providing a high level of service and support to customers."

Vice President of Sales at Expedient, Bryan Smith agreed, "These expansions (in Pittsburgh and in Cleveland) go hand-in-hand with our ability to provide complete hosted solutions to a variety of different kinds of organizations all across the country. Our customers like to see us evolve and I believe we are doing it while also improving customer service which is something I know we are all proud of as we grow."
