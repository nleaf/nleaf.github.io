Dublin, Ohio (October 9, 2014) On Tuesday, Expedient Data Centers welcomed representatives of the Governor’s office and the City of Dublin to officially break ground on their brand new data center located at 5700 Innovation Way. Expedient announced the ground-up build of its newest data center earlier this year, in response to the customer demand for highly available hosting solutions in Central Ohio. Expedient currently operates a 21,000 sq. ft. data center in Upper Arlington. The data center, which will be constructed in 3 phases, represents and estimated $55 Million dollar investment in high capacity, technology compute space. The initial phase, which is expected to be on line and available for customer use in Q3 2015, will be 29,000 sq. ft. of data center space, which provides hosting capacity for 575 racks of customer servers. The facility has been pre-designed for 2 additional expansions for a total of 60,000 sq. ft.
