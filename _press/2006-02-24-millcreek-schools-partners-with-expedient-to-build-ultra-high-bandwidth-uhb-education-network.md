Ethernet Anywhere® Service Debuts in Erie

(ERIE, PA - APRIL 22, 2006) - Expedient Data Centers, a national leader in carrier Ethernet, announced today that it will deploy its new Ethernet Anywhere technology throughout the Millcreek School District of Erie Pennsylvania. The new network will link 17 different locations delivering both data and voice services to students, teachers and administrative staff at each location. One of those locations has been dubbed the "Education Center" and serves as the central hub providing 10 megabits per second (Mbps) of Internet access for the entire District. The new network also makes use of new cost saving technologies like Voice over IP (VoIP).

"With Expedient we will be able to increase our bandwidth by 100 fold at no extra charge to the District," said Tom DelFratte, Technology Coordinator for the Millcreek School District. "The increased capacity will enable the District to take advantage of many new services and enhance education and communications."

The Millcreek Education Network is one of the first large-scale deployments of Expedient's Ethernet Anywhere in Erie. The national award-winning service was announced in November and is now in full operation in Erie's business district.

"Our Ethernet Anywhere rollout demonstrates Expedient's continuing progress and commitment to delivering next-generation connectivity to our customers," said Shawn McGorry, President and COO of Expedient Data Centers. "Ethernet Anywhere is currently recognized as the most economical way to deliver Ethernet connectivity, allowing customers to take advantage of video, voice and data all on the same circuit. We're proud to be delivering this breakthrough technology to the Erie community."

Chuck Peters, Expedient's local partner, underscored the company's commitment to the area. "So far in 2006, we've committed more than $100 thousand dollars to extend our Erie network, and we continue to add capacity and offer new services to local businesses. As we celebrate 12 years of providing service in Northwest Pennsylvania, we are excited to bring Ethernet Anywhere to the region and continue to focus on delivering the best network for our customers."

Expedient's all-Ethernet broadband network continues to offer a rapidly growing number of organizations the speed and scalability they need with Ethernet Anywhere. The company's premier service, Ethernet Anywhere is ideally suited for medium- and large-businesses that want the benefits of ultra high bandwidth but often find the network build-outs to be cost-prohibitive. Ethernet Anywhere augments and expands the reach of Expedient's extensive fiber optic network with technologies that can leverage traditional copper pairs in the last mile of the network, thereby avoiding costly, single purpose fiber plant extensions. The result is an end to end, high speed Ethernet circuit capable of supporting up to 40 Mbps. With the use of this technology, the Millcreek School District will maintain the flexibility to upgrade and expand their bandwidth on demand as their needs change at each unique location on the network.

Expedient's first deployed its Ethernet Anywhere service in Erie's downtown business district in March and has successfully delivered high speed Ethernet service to four distinct locations with several others already signed up.
