**Pittsburgh, PA (March 10, 2015) –** Expedient Data Centers, a leading national provider of cloud computing, managed services and colocation, today announced it has earned recognition on The Channel Company’s 2015 CRN Managed Service Provider (MSP) 500 list as one of the MSP Hosting 100. This annual list distinguishes the top technology providers and consultants in North America whose leading approach to managed services enables their customers to improve operational efficiencies, elicit greater value from their IT investments, and successfully leverage technology to achieve greater competitive advantage. 

In today’s world of outsourced IT, the expertise of MSPs has become increasingly important to organizations. The plethora of choices in terms of consumption and procurement of technology can become overwhelming. To help facilitate companies’ selection and adoption of managed services and providers, CRN, the leading media outlet for technology vendors and solution providers who serve end-user customers, has identified the top 500 MSPs. 

This year, CRN’s industry‐focused directory highlights the Top 500 MSPs in three categories: 100 Hosting Providers who are experienced in providing mainly off-premise, or cloud-based, services; 150 Elite Service Providers who are large data center-focused solution providers with a strong mix of on-premise professional services as well as off-premise services; and 250 Progressive Service Providers who have a business model heavily weighted toward managed services geared toward the small and midsize business market. 

“Expedient is pleased to be recognized on the MSP 500 list for 2015," Bryan Smith, Regional Vice President, states. "We continue to strive to provide the most reliable, available managed services that align with our customer needs. Our cloud computing platforms are housed in our 11 state of the art data centers that are managed 24x7x365 by our local on-site support staff. “  

“The allure of Everything-as-a-Service to organizations is largely rooted in the appeal of predictable operational expenses, cost-cutting, resource allocation and access to on-demand/pay-as-you-go technology. Therein lies a great need for the expertise of managed service providers,” said Robert Faletra, CEO, The Channel Company. “We congratulate the managed service providers who have engineered, or re-engineered, their businesses to deliver the services their customers rely on for future growth and ongoing success.” 

Coverage of the MSP500 will be featured in the February 2015 issue of CRN and online at [www.CRN.com](http://www.CRN.com),
