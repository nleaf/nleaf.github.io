**Pittsburgh (January 17, 2017) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service provider (IaaS), announced today that it has successfully completed self-certification with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, the new European Commission-approved mechanism that enables the transfer of personal data from Europe to the U.S. in compliance with European data protection law. As the successor to the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework introduces stronger obligations on the handling of data from the EU and provides greater protections for individuals. 

Having been previously compliant with Safe Harbor, the company did not hesitate to pursue this new mechanism. As a result, Expedient can now be found on the [Department of Commerce’s list of self-certified Privacy Shield participants](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list), which validates its assertion of compliance with the principles for the transfer of European personal data to the United States. More information on Expedient’s EU-US Privacy Shield Policy can be found [here](https://www.expedient.com/services/managed-services/compliance-security/eu-us-privacy-shield/).
