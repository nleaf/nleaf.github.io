**Pittsburgh, PA (September 12, 2016) —** Expedient, a leading cloud and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced the availability of a webinar, Software Defined Networking for Real Life Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS), overviewing its private and public DRaaS cloud capabilities using SAN-to-SAN and Host-to Host replication methods, with the use of with VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) and Zerto Virtual Replication. For the Push Button DR solution, Expedient is using the [Juniper Networks® vSRX Virtual Firewall](http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/security/srx-series/vsrx/), which is deployed as two-node clustered virtual machines that are replicated using either of the described methods. 

Maintaining real-time replication for mission-critical enterprise workloads is a complex challenge facing information technology professionals who are responsible for establishing and maintaining disaster recovery and business continuity strategies. In particular, the components of network security associated with firewalls present a particular challenge in maintaining resiliency across public networks. 

Expedient is delivering the DRaaS cloud solutions to address these challenges. With the use of VMware’s NSX technology, Expedient can create a hybrid network mesh through micro-segmentation between physical locations and dynamic routing protocols—including border gateway protocol (BGP)—to re-announce public internet protocol (IP) subnets when a disaster is declared by pushing a button in the customer self-service portal. “Push Button DR ensures that public IPs and all virtual network appliances—including firewalls—move with their connected computing workloads,” explained John White, vice president of product strategy at Expedient. 

In the recent webinar, moderated by Carl Brooks, an analyst of service providers at 451 Research, John White and Shishir Agrawal, senior manager of product management at Juniper Networks, reviewed how software-defined networking (SDN) is ensuring that replicated workloads are protected exactly the same in both primary and secondary sites. 

“Juniper Networks values working with Expedient since we launched our vSRX Virtual Firewall and integrated the technology into Expedient’s Push Button DR solution to create a true hybrid cloud experience,” said Shishir Agrawal, senior manager of product management at Juniper Networks. “We look forward to continuing our relationship with Expedient and further innovating on new technologies that will continue to enhance performance and deliver an exceptional customer experience.”
