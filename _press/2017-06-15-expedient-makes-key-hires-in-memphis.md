**Pittsburgh, PA (15 June 2017) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced two new hires in its Memphis market. 

Amit Kanda joins the organization as Memphis’ Market Vice President. Kanda is a Memphis IT veteran and recently served as Vice President of IT and Business Development at EVS Corporation, where his responsibilities included, among other things, oversight of the engineering and operations teams in the development and deployment of innovative new technology and service offerings. 

In his role as Market Vice President, Kanda is responsible for driving Expedient’s growth in the Memphis market and continuing to establish the company as a knowledgeable and trusted IT adviser to local organizations. 

“I was drawn to Expedient because of its focus on and commitment to its customers,” said Kanda. “Every solution is tailored to the individual requirements of the customer; that focus and dedication has made Expedient the leading cloud and colocation provider in the greater Memphis area. I am excited to be a part of the Expedient team and its continued growth.” 

Johnny Earnest joins Expedient as Solutions Architect for the Memphis market. Earnest’s most recent role was with Ericsson’s Global Services Cloud Center of Excellence where he worked with customers to roll-out Ericsson’s new Hyperscale Datacenter System line of servers, the world’s first complete system based on Intel’s Rack Scale Design software-defined infrastructure. 

Before joining Ericsson, Earnest spent 17 years at HP. As a Distinguished Technologist in HP’s Global Solutions Architecture & Engineering organization, Earnest worked with HP’s most strategic customers with a focus on mission critical computing, cloud, and big data. 

In his role as Solutions Architect, Earnest is responsible for consulting with Expedient prospects and customers to develop and implement tailored IT solutions that align with their business objectives. 

In addition to the two new hires, Rob Ward has moved into the role of Director of Market Strategy for the Memphis market, strengthening an already robust Memphis team that has experienced 389% sales growth year over year since June 2016.
