**Pittsburgh, PA (28 June 2018) –** Expedient, a cloud services and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced it was once again ranked in the top 10 managed services providers worldwide according to Channel Futures 11th annual MSP 501 Worldwide Company Rankings.

Expedient’s No. 7 position in the 2018 top 10 represents a move up three positions from its spot at No. 10 in the 2017 list. The MSP 501 is the first, largest and most comprehensive ranking of managed service providers worldwide.

As it has for the last three years, Channel Futures teamed with Clarity Channel Advisors to evaluate these progressive and forward-leaning companies. MSPs were ranked according to Channel Futures’ unique methodology, which recognizes that not all revenue streams are created equal, weighting revenue figures according to how well the applicant's business strategy anticipates trends in the fast-evolving channel ecosystem.

“We’re honored to again be ranked in the top 10 managed services providers in the world,” said Shawn McGorry, President and COO of Expedient. “This recognition is a testament to our commitment to operational excellence and the delivery of best-in-class technical solutions and services to the organizations that rely on us as their managed service provider.”

“This year’s applicant pool was the largest and most diverse in the history of the survey, and our winners represent the health and progressivity of the managed services market,” says Kris Blackmon, Channel Futures content director and editor of the MSP 501. “They’re growing their revenue, expanding their customer influence and exploring new technology that will propel them for years to come.”

The full MSP 501 report, available this fall, will leverage applicant responses, interviews and historical data to identify business and technology trends in the IT channel.
