**Pittsburgh, PA (9 April 2018) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, announced record growth in its 2017 Disaster Recovery as a Service revenues, which doubled for the second consecutive year.

Underscoring this milestone is Zerto’s announcement of Expedient as a Platinum Partner. Zerto is an industry leader in IT resiliency; its enterprise-class disaster recovery and business continuity software is a cornerstone of Expedient’s unique Push Button DR solution.

Expedient is one of only four cloud services providers globally to be named a Zerto Platinum Partner. This designation gives Expedient unprecedented access to Zerto’s technical and executive teams, enabling the organization to continue to provide a best-in-class DRaaS solution for its enterprise cloud customers.

With the widespread adoption of cloud-based solutions among enterprises of all sizes, the DRaaS market is expected to continue to experience rapid growth, with some forecasts estimating global market size at $12.54B by 2022.

Carl Brooks, analyst for 451 Research’s Service Providers Channel, said, “451 Research’s data indicates that disaster recovery and business continuity remain one of the most sought after use cases for cloud infrastructure. Expedient’s growth in the DRaaS market validates its ability to meet that demand.”

“As organizations increasingly depend on the cloud for IT resiliency, partnerships with leading cloud services providers like Expedient are more important than ever,” said Don Wales, Zerto VP, Global Cloud Sales. “Expedient’s DRaaS growth underscores the company’s cloud expertise, and we’re proud to have them as our newest Zerto Platinum Partner.”

“We feel that, being named a Zerto Platinum Partner, on the heels of our first-ever positioning in the 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Disaster Recovery as a Service, is a testament to our continued innovations in the DRaaS space,” said John White, VP Product Strategy for Expedient. “Doubling our year-over-year revenue growth in the category further affirms Expedient’s commitment to our DRaaS customers.”
