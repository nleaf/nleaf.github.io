**Pittsburgh, PA (18 June 2019) –** Expedient, a managed cloud and data center infrastructure as a service (“IaaS”) provider, announced today that it has once again, been named as one of the world’s premier managed service providers (“MSP’s”) by Channel Futures magazine, in accordance with their 2019, MSP 501 rankings. Expedient is ranked No. 12 in the MSP 501 this year. This is the 12th edition of the prestigious, MSP 501, which is a worldwide ranking.

Every year, thousands of MSPs from all  over the globe, voluntarily complete an extensive survey and application, to report their product offerings, growth rates, annual total and recurring revenues, pricing structures, revenue mix and more. MSPs were ranked according to a unique methodology that weights revenue figures according to how well the applicant’s business strategy anticipates trends in the fast-evolving channel ecosystem.

[Channel Futures](https://www.channelfutures.com/) is pleased to name Expedient to the 2019 MSP 501.

“It’s a great honor to once again be ranked near the very top of Channel Futures’ MSP 501,” said Shawn McGorry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Expedient. “Expedient’s ranking as the 12th best managed service provider in the world underscores the success of our cloud and managed services solutions set, as recognized by the channel partner community.

In the 12 years since its inception, the MSP 501 has evolved from a competitive ranking list into a vibrant group of service providers, vendors, distributors, consultants and industry analysts working together to identify the service providers who are best responding to the growing managed service opportunity.

“The 2019 MSP 501 winners are the most elite, innovative and strategic IT service providers on the planet, and they stand as a model of excellence in the industry,” says Kris Blackmon, Content Director of Channel Partners and Channel Futures and lead of the MSP 501 program. “As the MSP 501 Community grows, leagues of managed service providers learn from the successes of these winning companies, gaining insight into the best practices, strategies and technologies that elevate an MSP to the level of the 501 winners. Our heartfelt congratulations to the 2019 winners and gratitude to the thousands of MSPs that have contributed to the continuing growth and success of both the 501 and the thriving managed services sector.”
