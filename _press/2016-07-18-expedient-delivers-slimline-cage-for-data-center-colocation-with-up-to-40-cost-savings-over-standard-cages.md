**Pittsburgh, PA (July 18, 2016) —** The components that make up the cost of colocation service include computer room floor space, electrical power and network connectivity. Most data centers offering colocation service have a cage solution for organizations that desire additional control. Unfortunately, the design of these cages often consumes additional floor space equivalent to several additional cabinets. As a result, clients often pay a premium because the provider is unable to resell that stranded space.

[SlimLine Cage designs](http://bit.ly/2agQKps) from Expedient eliminate the need for additional floor space by fitting the exact profile of the cabinets enclosed within them while still delivering maximum mobility. With as few as four (4) cabinets, Expedient can create a tailored cage solution that eliminates the additional monthly expense associated with stranded computer room floor space. 

[A SlimLine Cage](https://www.expedient.com/services/infrastructure-as-a-service/colocation/cages/) is designed and fabricated to exacting standards that accommodate cabinets positioned among predefined rows supporting existing hot/cold aisle configurations with either solid or perforated roll-up doors that facilitate full access to front and back entry points.

“The flexibility of [SlimLine Cage configurations](http://bit.ly/28VypOd) enables our clients to achieve up to a 40 percent cost savings over that of a standard colocation cage because of the efficient use of space,” according to Ken Hill, Chief Technology Officer of Expedient.

In each of its eleven (11) data centers, Expedient provides 24x7x365 service, including support for services complementary to colocation, such as cross connects and remote hands. Mission-critical information technology workloads hosted in Expedient data centers benefit from the operational rigor associated with redundant power and environmental and access surveillance systems. Hosting can be arranged in hybrid configurations allowing clients to take advantage of managed hosting services, including disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS), in order to achieve and maintain compliance with a variety of industry and government mandates.
