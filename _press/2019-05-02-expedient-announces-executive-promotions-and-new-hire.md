**Pittsburgh, PA (2 May 2019) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service provider, today announced that, in the course of restructuring with an eye towards expansion, it has promoted two corporate executives and made a key hire to lead its new national sales team.

Jonathan Rosenson, former Senior Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, has been promoted to Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, assuming COO responsibilities from Shawn McGorry, who remains Expedient’s President. Rosenson’s career with Expedient—and its predecessor companies—has spanned nearly 25 years, during which time he has been a key contributor in transformation efforts across the organization. Rosenson continues to be responsible for the marketing, partner alliances, technical support, IT compliance, information systems, and other operational functions of the organization.

John White, former Vice President of Product Strategy, has been promoted to Senior Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer. White began his career with Expedient in 2004 and has been instrumental in leading the company’s evolution from data center colocation provider to a renowned cloud services provider. In his new role, White will continue to serve as the organization’s most senior technologist, sitting on the technical advisory boards of some of the world’s leading software and hardware companies, while also driving forward Expedient’s solutions roadmap and vision.

In an effort to support aggressive expansion goals, the company has also announced the formation of a national sales team, led by John McKenna, the company’s new Vice President of Strategic Initiatives. McKenna brings to Expedient nearly 25 years of experience in technology and cloud computing leadership roles. In this newly created position, McKenna is responsible for expanding Expedient’s footprint into several new key markets.

The promotions and new hire continue Expedient’s 2019 momentum, which thus far has seen the company be named VMware’s Americas Cloud Partner of the Year, as well as receive recognition on numerous CRN lists, including the Managed Services Provider 500 and the Tech Elite 250.

“More so than any time I’ve seen previously in my 20-plus year career with the company, Expedient is positioned for explosive growth,” said Shawn McGorry, President. “We’re riding an incredible wave of momentum, with accolades from leading vendor partners like VMware and Zerto and validation of our solutions from analysts and industry pundits alike. I’m thrilled to be promoting Jon Rosenson and John White, who have devoted so much of their careers to this organization’s growth and success, and I’m excited to see what they will accomplish in their roles.”
