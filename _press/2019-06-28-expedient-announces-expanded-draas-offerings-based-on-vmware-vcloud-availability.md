**Pittsburgh, PA (28 June 2019) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service provider, today announced general availability of expanded Disaster Recovery as a Service (“DRaaS”) offerings running on VMware vCloud Availability, a unified solution built to offer simple, more secure, and cost-effective onboarding, migration, and disaster recovery services for multi-tenant VMware clouds.

“By expanding our disaster recovery solutions to now include replication powered by VMware vCloud Availability, Expedient is furthering our commitment to enabling organizations of all sizes to protect their workloads from unexpected events,” said John White, Chief Innovation Officer for Expedient. “We recognize that organizations have workloads that require varying levels of protection from disaster, and we continue to answer those needs with an evolving suite of disaster recovery solutions.”

VMware vCloud Availability gives cloud providers the ability to capitalize on this demand and deliver increased choice to end users. Additionally, as enterprises increasingly implement a hybrid cloud strategy, vCloud Availability provides an opportunity for cloud providers to deliver simple, integrated migration and onboarding services to the cloud and from cloud to cloud.
