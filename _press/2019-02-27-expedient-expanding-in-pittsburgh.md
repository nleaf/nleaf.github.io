**Pittsburgh, PA (27 February 2019) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced an expansion of its Pittsburgh headquarters in the city’s newest technology hub, Nova Place.

With the expansion, which increases office space by 40%, Expedient will comprise the entire sixth floor of Nova Tower 1, overlooking Downtown Pittsburgh. Formerly Allegheny Center Mall, Nova Place has undergone significant renovation in recent years, and is now home to many technology-related organizations. The office space expansion will support Expedient’s hiring plans for 2019.

The headquarters office space is in addition to its two data centers in the area; one also in Nova Place, and another in Green Tree. Combined, the facilities give Expedient more than 70,000 square feet of operating space in the Pittsburgh region.

The office expansion comes on the heels of Expedient’s $14.5 million, 10,000-square-foot expansion of its Nova Place data center, which was celebrated with an open house and a proclamation of “Expedient Day in Pittsburgh” in January 2018.
