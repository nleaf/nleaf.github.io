(CLEVELAND,OH - OCTOBER 24, 2005) -Â In a world of telecom giants, being a small, Midwestern Internet service provider requires some innovation to survive.

For local ISP Expedient, months of research and development on a new Internet service are starting to pay off.

The company has added 13 sales employees around the country since launching a new product called Ethernet Anywhere earlier this year. It plans to add 13 more before the end of the year, said Bryan Smith, the company's vice president of sales.

The Ethernet Anywhere product, which Expedient says is cheaper, faster way to connect to the Internet than other high-speed connections, has helped Expedient land 50 new customers and accounts for 50% to 70% of the company's new business, Mr. Smith said.

It plans to open new offices in Cincinnati and Philadelphia next year, Mr. Smith said.

Expedient was founded in Cleveland in 2001 and splits its corporate operations between a 25-person office here and a Pittsburgh office. Nationwide it has 84 employees in offices in Cleveland, Miami, PIttsburgh, San Francisco and suburban Boston.
