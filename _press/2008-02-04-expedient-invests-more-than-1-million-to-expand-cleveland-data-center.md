Cleveland data center to ramp-up power and space with additions to existing state-of-the-art facility

Cleveland, Ohio - February 4, 2008 - Expedient, a leading provider of data center colocation and managed data network services for local business customers in Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Boston, announces the beginning of a million dollar-plus expansion initiative within its Cleveland area data center, located in the suburb of Garfield Heights.

To be completed by April, the investment supports Expedient's extraordinary growth curve which has been in progression since early last year. In 2007, Expedient's business in Cleveland grew by more than 50%. While plans initially forecasted a need for this expansion in 2009, the company is pleased to move up the timing to accommodate new growth.

"This addition will allow us to dramatically expand our ability to serve customers with critical services," said Shawn McGorry, President of Expedient. "In a banner year such as we're having our first priority is to invest in growth with an eye toward exceeding our customers' expectations."

Upgrades consist of adding 4,500 sq. ft. of data center space to accommodate more than 160 new cabinets, and increasing power distribution capabilities. Investment in the electric infrastructure will include two 300 KVa Liebert UPSs and a second 1.25 MW Caterpillar emergency generator.

Capabilities already in place in the facility include redundant UPS's, 450 tons of HVAC, FM-200 fire suppression, a diesel generator producing 1.25 Megawatts of power, video camera surveillance, key card entrance, and lockable cabinets. Based on its recent growth Expedient projects that more than half of the new space and infrastructure investment will be used by customers before the end of this year.

The Cleveland data center is connected with other data centers around the country via multi-Gbps, long-haul fiber optic rings. This provides direct access to multiple tier 1 providers, a high availability network including firewalls and load balancers, and on-site engineers and a Network Operating Center to provide premier support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Bryan Smith, Vice President of Sales at Expedient, says the company has targeted growth well beyond the Cleveland/Akron corridor. "Improvements like these make us competitive with the biggest providers anywhere," said Smith. "As more customers in surrounding markets learn about our strength and ability to provide reliable service, we will keep well ahead of demands."
