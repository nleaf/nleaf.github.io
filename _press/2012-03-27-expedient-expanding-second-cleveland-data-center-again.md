(Cleveland, Ohio) March 26, 2012 - Expedient, leading provider of colocation, cloud computing, managed hosting services and connectivity has kicked-off a significant expansion of their NEO 152 data center within NEO Park, which was originally opened in October of 2009.

This project will double the amount of data processing space at Expedient’s 2nd Cleveland data center and will expand the current facility to a total of 21,000 square feet. This is Expedient’s sixth data center expansion in Cleveland since 2006 and is slated for completion in April 2012. “We are pleased with the accelerating demand for cloud and colocation services in the Cleveland market and we look forward to the opportunities that our expansion projects will provide to our valued clients,” Bryan Smith, Regional Vice President states.

The new 7,000 sq. ft. facility will be contiguous to their current data center and is a seven month, multi-million dollar project. Expedient currently operates in six cities including Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Columbus, Baltimore and Boston. The new facility will immediately become part of the multi-city network of data centers via connection to a fully redundant 10Gig fiber backbone. Expedient’s new data center will provide companies with the ideal environment for economically hosting their business critical applications, enabling them to increase the availability of their companies’ data. It will also house Expedient’s 4th generation of cloud/virtual hosting pods; each pod has over 3,000GB of memory that can be allocated to customers in 1GB increments. “This expansion is being built in response to the region’s appetite for more cost-effective and reliable IT outsourcing solutions, and driven by customer demand for our unique mix of products and services”, Smith comments.

Once the expansion has been completed the NEO152 Data Center will have top tier features including 13,000 sq. ft. of raised floor, dual power feeds, four 750KW Caterpillar generators, 500 tons of cooling, diverse telecommunications fiber infrastructure, multi-tiered security system, FE25 fire suppression system and a fully staffed 24x7x365 Operations Support Center (OSC).

Expedient will be conducting free annual IT reviews for companies at the new data center from May 7-12th and hosting a special one-day Open House event on May 10th. Interested parties from the business and technology community are invited to tour as this will be the first and only time that public tours will be available at the new data center.

“This year will be a continuation of our record growth year in 2011. Last year we completed five data center expansions and upgrades, launched a new market in Columbus, and released multiple new hosted products”, Smith states. “Please take two minutes and watch a short video that provides a complete overview of what we have been up to at http://bit.ly/y78cJY For additional information on the new Expedient data center or Expedient services, contact Bryan Smith or visit [www.expedient.com.](https://www.expedient.com/)
