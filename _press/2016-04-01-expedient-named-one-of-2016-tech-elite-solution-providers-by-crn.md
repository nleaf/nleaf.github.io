**Pittsburgh, PA (March 29, 2016) –** Expedient announced today that [CRN](http://www.crn.com/)®, a brand of [The Channel Company](http://www.thechannelcompany.com/), has named Expedient to its 2016 Tech Elite 250 list. This annual list honors an exclusive group of North American IT solution providers that have earned the highest number of advanced technical certifications from leading technology vendors. 

To compile the annual list, The Channel Company’s research group and CRN editors work together to identify the most customer-beneficial technical certifications in the North American IT channel. Companies who have obtained these elite designations—which enable solution providers to deliver premium products, services and customer support—are then selected from a pool of online applicants. 

Technology is always innovating, changing and expanding. Expedient recognizes the need to grow with it and ensuring its employees stay up to date with the latest certifications is one way to do that. Expedient also offers tuition reimbursement to its employees to further their education in pursuit of career advancement. 

“The solution providers selected for our annual Tech Elite 250 list have demonstrated a commitment to excellence and gained strong industry credibility by earning some of the most difficult IT certifications available from top technology vendors,” said Robert Faletra, CEO, The Channel Company. “Attainment of these exclusive certifications strengthens the channel as a whole by invigorating partnerships and enabling the delivery of exceptional customer service. We congratulate each of these organizations and look forward to their continued success.” 

“At Expedient, we place a high value on continuous learning and encourage all of our employees to achieve any certification, training or education credential that would be beneficial to their career in alignment with our business,” says Jonathan H. Rosenson, Vice President of Quality Assurance and Strategic Initiatives for Expedient. “In the past year, many of our staff have earned certifications from Zerto, VMware, Cisco, Juniper, Red Hat, Microsoft and more, proving their dedication and ours to providing the most knowledgeable customer service experience for our customers.” 

Coverage of the Tech Elite 250 will be featured in the April issue of CRN, and online at [www.crn.com](http://www.crn.com).
