Pittsburgh, Pa. - July 25, 2007 -Â Expedient Data Centers announces it is hosting a Tech Fair on July 26, 2007, from Noon to three o'clock p.m. at its 810 Parrish Street facility. Open to any local business owners, senior management and IT professionals, the event will feature speakers from EMC, VMware and Plan IT and will also feature data center tours. Guests will also enjoy a BBQ lunch.

"We enjoy hosting these kinds of events as a way of informally addressing some of today's technology trends," explains Shawn McGorry, president of Expedient Data Centers. "We also find that the facility tours and informational speakers' programs help both our current and potential customers understand the broad range of expertise we bring to the table."

At the event, Brad Steckline from EMC will discuss both "Avamar" and "Managing Storage Infrastructure"; VMware's Jeff Eiben and Daniel Dulick will present information on "Server Consolidation and Containment as well as Business Continuity", and John Hudson from Plan IT will present "10 Reasons Why Business Continuity Planning Fails - What You Can Do About It."
