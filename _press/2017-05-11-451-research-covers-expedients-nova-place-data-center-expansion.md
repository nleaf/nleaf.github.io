**Pittsburgh, PA (11 May 2017) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced the publication of a [451 Research Impact Report](https://www.expedient.com/451-research-pitt-expansion/?utm_source=prnewswire&utm_medium=press%20release) focused on Expedient’s data center expansion in Pittsburgh and strong position among both national and regional cloud and managed services providers. 

With an expected completion in November 2017, the $14 million expansion at Expedient’s Nova Place data center adds 10,000 square feet of new raised floor computer room space and cloud capacity for IaaS and disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) solutions. Several thousand additional square feet will be dedicated to fully redundant switchgear, Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems, and emergency generators with up to two megawatts of demand and fuel capacity. The renovated and expanded facility will be powered by new dedicated and redundant commercial utility power service. 

The Nova Place data center expansion is Expedient’s third such undertaking in Pittsburgh in 14 years, and its second major expansion project this year, following an 8,000-square-foot expansion and renovation of Expedient’s Boston data center that was completed in March 2017. 

“We’ve been proud to call Pittsburgh home for more than 15 years,” said David Saliba, Regional Vice President for Expedient. “This investment in the Nova Place data center demonstrates our continued commitment to the Western Pennsylvania region, and solidifies our position as a leading regional provider of IaaS solutions.” 

Like all Expedient data centers, Nova Place offers all Expedient services from physical server colocation to public and private cloud infrastructure, and a suite of managed IT infrastructure services, along with 24x7x365 on-site support. All Expedient data centers are connected through Layer 2 network access and a minimum 10Gbps private fiber backbone, creating a powerful distributed presence for critical IT infrastructure services. And, all Expedient data centers offer SOC 1 (SSAE-18) and SOC 2 audit attestations, and support customers’ needs to meet PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and other industry/regulatory compliance mandates.
