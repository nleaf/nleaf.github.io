Columbus, OH – When it comes to technology, it pays to stay ahead – and to partner wisely. In aligning with leading technology provider Expedient Data Centers, Columbus’ Strategic Insurance Software (SIS) has done both.

“We understand the importance of working with the right partner to bring the best expertise to the business solution to maximize efficiency, capability, and value,” said SIS CEO, Alex Deak. “It’s what we do for our customers and what we look for in our business partners”.

Relying on Expedient’s industry expertise and network of secure SSAE18 compliant data centers, SIS recently completed a whole scale cloud infrastructure upgrade to their Partner XE insurance agency management system platform. Partner XE, and all associated client data, is now housed on Expedient’s highest capacity cloud computing network with the latest Storage Area Network (SAN) technology.

Not only does the new SAN technology increase capacity and eliminate potential data access bottlenecks, it also enables data replication to any of the Expedient data centers for faster disaster recovery and more redundancy for maximum availability. Expedient currently has eight data centers in five states with additional locations coming.

“We are proud that our clients often view Expedient as an extension of their internal team and we take that responsibility seriously,” said Bryan Smith Regional Vice President for Expedient. “It is our responsibility to provide clients like SIS with a platform that is always available and is designed to scale as their business needs change.” SIS benefits from a more dynamic platform that paves the way for expansion, growth and leading edge development. Their agency clients benefit from improved system accessibility, reliability and security.

"Our close relationship with Expedient and their industry leading cloud experts allows us to continue improving all aspects of the Partner XE product and customer experience with the assurance that the underlying foundation remains resilient," said Mensur Sejfovic, SIS Director of Operations. “ With the redundancies Expedient has in place, their around the clock service and the 24/7/365 nature of the cloud, no natural disaster should ever prevent an agency from access to its data.”

“Technology is continually changing and so is our business,” added Deak. “Working with Expedient assures our customers of the best combination of technology capability, scalability, reliability, and security.
