(Columbus, Ohio) November 29, 2010 Expedient Data Centers, a leading provider of colocation, managed services and connectivity with newly established operations in the Columbus area, announced today that they have partnered with Nationwide Children's Hospital as a "Business Buddy."

Expedient will kick off its support of Children's Hospital in conjunction with their recently announced, Grand Opening - Open House. Expedient will donate a toy to the Hospital, in the name of every person that attends their Open House. Expedient is also encouraging Open House attendees to donate toys as well, by suggesting that guests bring an unwrapped toy when they visit the facility. This is the beginning of what Expedient intends to be a strong partnership with Children's Hospital, with commitments to volunteer at various upcoming events, including the radio telethon and golf events.

The main toy drive will take place during the December 9th Open House, at Expedient's new data center, located at 5000 Arlington Center Blvd in Upper Arlington, OH. This facility is Expedient's first [data center in the Columbus area](https://www.expedient.com/products/columbus-data-center.php) and their eighth data center in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Other data centers are located in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Baltimore and Boston. The new Data Center will have top-tier systems including dual commercial power feeds, redundant generators, N+2 cooling systems, multi-carrier telecommunications infrastructure, multiple-tiered security system, two fire suppression systems, and a fully-staffed Operations Support Center (OSC).

Members of the Expedient executive management team will be on hand to greet visitors, give tours, answer questions and generally introduce Expedient's plans for its Columbus Service offerings. Software Systems, Network and Electrical Facility Engineers will also be on-site to provide technical overviews and to answer specific questions from the IT/IS community.
