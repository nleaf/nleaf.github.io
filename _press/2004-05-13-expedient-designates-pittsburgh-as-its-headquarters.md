Data Center lease renewed; former Stargate COO McGorry named Expedient President.

(PITTSBURGH, PA - MAY 13, 2004) -Â Expedient announced today that its Pittsburgh office, located in the Strip District's Crane Building, has been formally designated as the company's headquarters.

Expedient acquired the Commercial Services and Data Center businesses (dba "Stargate Business") of the former Stargate.net last October, and all operations now are under the Expedient brand. Expedient will maintain a significant presence in Cleveland, where it was headquartered for the past three years, and where the company continues to service a substantial client roster.

With this move, Expedient plans to capitalize further on Stargate Business' solid infrastructure, which attracted Expedient during the original acquisition. Those virtues include an experienced management team and professional staff, plus world-class information systems. Integrating Expedient into the former Stargate Business operations framework also will enable Expedient to realize its growth potential more effectively.

"The transition has gone according to plan or better," said Steve Abbey, chairman of Expedient. "We bought Stargate for its strong customer base and consistent revenues, but its strategic assets and talented workforce quickly became equally meaningful."

Abbey and his associate, Steve Willens, are Expedient's principal investors. Willens is credited with authoring the RADIUS program, a key Internet authentication protocol, and was a founder of Livingston Enterprises, a networking technology company later acquired by Lucent.

Roughly seventy percent of Expedient's workforce is now located in Pittsburgh. The company employs approximately 100 people and is currently looking to fill a dozen new positions, primarily in sales and engineering roles.

### Greentree Data Center Lease Renewed

To further anchor operations in Pittsburgh, Expedient has renewed the lease for its Greentree data center with the Massaro Company for five more years. This underscores Expedient's commitment to provide a full suite of Commercial, IP-based solutions, including both enhanced transport and data center hosting.

### New Executives Named

As part of the overall commitment to growing both its Pittsburgh and Cleveland locations, several new executive appointments have been made:

Shawn McGorry, former Chief Operating Officer of Stargate and twenty-year veteran of the telecommunications industry, has been named President of Expedient. McGorry will remain in Pittsburgh and will be responsible for day-to-day operations, executive management reporting functions and the overall growth strategies for the organization.

Brad Reynolds, Chief Executive Officer of Expedient, will retain that title with the addition of "strategic product development," while splitting his time between Cleveland and Pittsburgh. The shift will allow Reynolds, a seasoned Internet entrepreneur, to focus on new technologies, particularly the launch of Expedient's Voice over IP (VOIP) services, the latest innovation in flexible, Internet-based telephony technology.

Ken Misch, a 15-year finance Executive who most recently served as vice president of finance for PrintCafe, a Pittsburgh-based technology concern that was recently acquired by Electronics for Imaging, has been named Expedient CFO. Misch, a Cleveland native, will stay in Pittsburgh.
