Expedient engages Chuck Peters to assist with its expansion and the roll out of new technology/Product Line, Ethernet Anywhere.

(ERIE, PA - SEPTEMBER 28, 2005) -Â Charles (Chuck) Peters a long-time, active member of the Erie Technology community, has entered into a partnership with Expedient Data Centers, a Pittsburgh based commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP), to advise, oversee and represent its business interest in the Northwestern Pennsylvania market. Expedient provides Commercial Internet Services to customers in 18 markets nationwide, including Erie, which represents Expedient's fifth largest market, behind Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Miami and Boston. Peters has been involved directly with broadband Internet in Erie since 1996, first as founder of McNutt Peters Creative Group, then as a partner in ErieNet and Regional Manager and Minority Shareholder of Stargate. In 2001, Peters co-founded the Northwest Pennsylvania Technology Council, a trade association of local tech-oriented companies that promotes and expands the deployment of technology in the Northwest PA region. Peters still serves as the organization's Chairman. Peters latest venture, the Liquid Group, has agreed to join forces with Expedient to further expand their business in NorthWest PA. "I've stayed very close to the Industry over the past two years and believe strongly that Northwest PA continues to need an extremely focused and strong business ISP," Peters stated. "Many people have encouraged me to get more involved in the industry. Expedient is a strong player in both traditional Internet services and through its Ethernet Anywhere product line. The company is able to deliver to Erie the most efficient IP transport services such as Metro Ethernet over fiber and Ethernet over copper. The timing is right and the company is right."

Peters had been keeping an eye on Expedient's roll out of its Ethernet products in Pittsburgh and Cleveland and became convinced that his participation would facilitate further investment into Expedient's Erie territory. Initially, Expedient will expand its Ethernet Anywhere product reach, by deploying its Ethernet over copper capabilities in the downtown area first, with the ability to expand to outside the primary business district as demand increases. Expedient expects to have the downtown build complete by the end of this year. Ethernet Anywhere takes established Ethernet technology and extends it beyond the local area network (LAN) environment into a wide area network (WAN). Bandwidth selections begin at 5Mbps of service and continue all the way to 40Mbps with tiered options in between.

According to Shawn McGorry, the President of Expedient, "Chuck has shown tremendous leadership in the community and he fought hard to bring Broadband to the area. He was a pioneer in several DSL, wireless and cable modem applications. When we told him about our plans to bring Ethernet Anywhere to Erie, he simply had to be involved."

Rick Novotny, Executive Director Corry Economic Development Corporation stated "Chuck has always been an innovator when it comes to promoting technology in NorthWest PA. Having Peters again involved with the industry should bring exciting opportunities for Erie businesses."

The team plans to hire additional sales and engineering staff to support the Erie market.
