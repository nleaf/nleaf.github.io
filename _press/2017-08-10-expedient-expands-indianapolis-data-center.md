**Pittsburgh, PA (10 August 2017) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced a planned $4.5 million expansion and upgrade of its data center in Carmel, Indiana. This is Expedient’s third expansion and upgrade of the Indianapolis data center since September 2013, and reflects continued customer demand for greater capacity, redundancy, and reliability. The three projects combined represent a total investment of $14.5 million dollars. 

With a planned completion in November 2017, the expansion will add 3,500 square feet of computer room space, increasing raised floor space to 26,000 square feet, in addition to 12,500 square feet of electrical/mechanical rooms and more than 15,000 square feet of office, common area, and convenience spaces. Additional planned upgrades include the replacement of two uninterruptable power supply (UPS) systems, the installation of new computer room air conditioning units (CRAC) and power distribution units (PDU), and design improvements and additional cooling capacity for the HVAC system, resulting in a higher level of redundancy for Expedient customers. 

“We’re proud of our continued growth in the Indianapolis area,” said Jim Kothe, Regional Vice President for Expedient. “Our investment in the Indianapolis data center demonstrates our absolute commitment to supporting our customers’ evolving needs, and further solidifies our position as an industry-leading regional provider of IaaS solutions.”

All Expedient data centers are connected through Layer 2 network access and a multi-gigabit private fiber backbone, creating a powerful distributed presence for critical IT infrastructure services.
