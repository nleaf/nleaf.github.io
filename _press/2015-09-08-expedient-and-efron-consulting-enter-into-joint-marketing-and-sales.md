Efron Consulting and Expedient have entered into a joint marketing and sales arrangement. Efron Consulting, a global organization, is engaged with Fortune 500 companies in providing IT solutions. Expedient, a data center and cloud provider, offers a full spectrum of leading-edge hosting and cloud services. The joint management teams see synergistic opportunities to support each other for the benefit of their clients. In the age of outsourcing and cloud management, IT managers are looking to buy, not build. Efron works closely with IT managers to provide application development and infrastructure-related services. 

“We know this partnership will be a great fit for both Expedient and Efron Consulting,” says Shawn Allaway, regional vice president, Expedient. “Our combined IT expertise and dedication to a highly consultative customer experience will benefit businesses in the New England region and throughout the United States. We are excited to get started.” 

This new relationship with Expedient is a natural expansion of the dialog with their clients. Expedient offers private cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud, colocation, virtualization and other related services. Efron will be able to help augment Expedient’s service offerings with a wrapper of high level dynamic IT services. The two organizations will mutually support each other’s efforts to leverage expertise and bring value to their clients.
