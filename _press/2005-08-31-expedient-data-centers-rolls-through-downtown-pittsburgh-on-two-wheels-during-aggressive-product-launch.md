(PITTSBURGH, PA - AUGUST 31, 2005) -Â If you have been strolling the streets downtown during lunch the past week you have probably noticed a very strange scene. And no, you were not dreaming, that was a "train" of nine Segway's crossing the street. Segways, being an innovative product in their own right, go hand-in-hand with the innovative product that Expedient has launched the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

In an effort to blanket the downtown Pittsburgh area and create awareness of their new product "Ethernet Anywhere", Expedient Data Centers has deployed a squad of Segway's armed with marketing materials to hand out to unsuspecting business men and woman. The message is clear: "Ethernet has come to Pittsburgh." Expedient can now deliver Internet access and private lines up to 26 times faster than a T-1 connection at a more affordable price-point. By delivering access via Ethernet over existing copper lines, companies receive many of the benefits of a fiber-optic connection without the heavy installation costs. Continuing Tuesday, September 6th, the Segways will be out in force through the close of the week. Stop by and say hi, we'd love to see you.
