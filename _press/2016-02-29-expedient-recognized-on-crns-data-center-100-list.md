**Pittsburgh, PA (February 29, 2016) –** Expedient, a leading provider of data center colocation, cloud computing and managed hosting services, announced today that [CRN**®**](http://www.crn.com/), a brand of [The Channel Company](http://www.thechannelco.com/), has named Expedient to its 2016 Data Center 100 list. This annual lineup recognizes technology suppliers who excel at powering, supporting and protecting the complex and demanding data centers on which today’s businesses rely. 

CRN editors select companies for the Data Center 100 list on the basis of multiple criteria, including each company's overall impact on the market, its influence on the channel as a whole, and the types of technology and services it makes available to its partners. 

In addition to recognizing technology suppliers for outstanding products and services, the Data Center 100 serves as a valuable guide for solution providers looking for best-in-class vendors providing everything from data backup tools to virtual data center solutions to cloud hosting services. 

Expedient was named to the CRN Data Center 100 list for the fourth year in a row as a result of its portfolio of state-of-the-art data centers. The company currently has 11 facilities in the following cities: Boston, Baltimore (2), Cleveland (2), Columbus (2), Indianapolis, Memphis and Pittsburgh (2). All of Expedient’s data centers are interconnected with a 10Gbps private fiber backbone and feature 24x7x365 on-site support. 

“Building and maintaining an efficient, reliable data center is a monumental task, requiring a wide range of technologies, including a combination of hardware and software that provides just the right fit,” said Robert Faletra, CEO, The Channel Company. “Vendors who can deliver this breadth and depth of materials and services are an invaluable resource to today’s solution providers, and we are pleased to present the best of those companies in the 2016 Data Center 100 list.” 

“We are truly grateful to be named to the CRN Data Center 100 list again this year,” says Jonathan H. Rosenson, Vice President of Quality Assurance and Strategic Initiatives for Expedient. “2015 was an exciting year for our team attributable to the opening of two new data centers, one in Memphis, TN, and the other in Dublin, Ohio. Local data centers enable our strategy of delivering colocation, cloud and managed infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solutions where our clients need them to achieve desired business outcomes.” 

The Data Center 100 list will be featured in the February 2016 issue of CRN and online at [www.CRN.com/datacenter100](http://www.CRN.com/datacenter100).
