Cleveland data center to ramp-up power and space with fourth round of additions to its state-of-the-art facility

Cleveland, Ohio - August 26, 2008 - Expedient, a leading provider of data center colocation and managed services for local and national business customers in Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Boston, announces it has completed the fourth phase of its Cleveland data center expansion, the beginning of which was first announced in February. In total Expedient has invested over $2 million dollars into the Garfield Heights facility in the last year.

Current upgrades consist of adding 3,800 sq. ft. of data center space and an additional 90 tons of cooling to the 450 tons already in place. The improvements will also provide a raised floor and FM-200 fire suppression. "We have already started planning a new $10 million dollar facility due to the rate in which we have been filling our existing Cleveland data center," said Bryan Smith, Vice President of Sales.

Capabilities currently in place in the facility include four redundant UPS's, 450 tons of HVAC, FM-200 fire suppression, dual diesel generators producing 2.5 Megawatts of power, video camera surveillance, key card entrance, and lockable cabinets. The Cleveland data center is connected with Expedient's other data centers around the country via 10Gbps, long-haul fiber optic rings. This provides direct access to multiple Tier 1 providers, a high availability network including firewalls and load balancers, and on-site engineers and a Network Operating Center to provide premier support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
