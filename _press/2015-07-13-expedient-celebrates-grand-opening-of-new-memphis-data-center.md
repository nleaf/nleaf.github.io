**Memphis, TN (July 13, 2015) -** Expedient, a leading provider of data center colocation, cloud computing and managed hosting services, is hosting a grand opening with an open house on Thursday, July 16th from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. for its newest data center, the first top-tier data center in Memphis, Tenn. This opening will mark the 11th data center in 7 cities for Expedient. 

Expedient chose Memphis because local companies expressed the need for a high-quality hosting provider that would invest in the community and become a true partner. In addition, Memphis’s commitment to meet not only business demands for reliable infrastructure, but also provide the highly qualified workforce needed to support sophisticated technologies, are reasons why Expedient is excited to launch its Memphis data center.

"We are excited to show the local Memphis community the finished data center and how it can help solve their most pressing IT infrastructure problems," says Jim Kothe, Mid-South Vice President. “We’ve already hired several people from Memphis in our support center, sales and engineering teams and will continue to do so as we grow.” 

The community can visit the local data center located at 3180 Players Lane, at the open house on Thursday, July 16, from 11:30 a.m. until 5 p.m. Expedient’s solutions architects and executives will be on-site giving tours of the facility. Refreshments will be served and three iPads, courtesy of VMware, will be given away. 

Expedient, [a VMware Hybrid Cloud Powered services provider in the vCloud Air Network](http://vcloudproviders.vmware.com/providers/Continental-Broadband-LLC), currently operates in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Columbus, Boston, Baltimore and now Memphis. Like its existing data centers, the new facility will be seamlessly connected to the company’s 10 other data centers, by its fully redundant, 10Gbps fiber optic backbone network. The Memphis data center is 35,000 square feet with 7,500 square feet of raised floor production space, which runs the latest technology architected in an N+2 configuration. The data center is monitored 24x7x365 by local Operations Support Center staff and is fully secured by multiple mantraps and biometric hand scanners. 

In addition to the new Memphis facility, construction is underway on Expedient’s second data center in the Columbus, Ohio, area. The new building in Dublin, Ohio, is scheduled to be opened in November 2015.
