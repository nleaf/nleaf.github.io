Cleveland, OH, November 11, 2014 – Expedient, a National leader in Data Centers, Managed Hosting and Cloud Computing Services, announced today the appointment of David Saliba to the position of Regional Vice President for the Cleveland market. In his new role, Saliba will help expand Expedient’s position as a technology thought leader and leading solutions provider in Northeast Ohio. In less than two months Expedient will open its new 13,000 square feet data center expansion in Cleveland, the 7th such addition since 2006. With the new capacity coming on line, combined with the increasing demand for Cloud Services and related managed hosting products, Saliba will expand Expedient’s regional team with at least two new members of the sales force. He has already been active in solidifying strong partnerships with other technology thought leaders throughout the region. Saliba has been with Expedient since January 2006, primarily serving as the Regional Sales Director for the Pittsburgh market and for the last year, has also provided sales leadership for the Cleveland market. Saliba’s leadership has been a key factor in Expedient’s growth, especially in the growing Managed Services and hybrid products space. He has established relationships with a wide variety of customers ranging from Fortune 1000 companies to small and medium sized businesses. Saliba brings experience and strong business acumen to Expedient’s Cleveland operation. Prior to joining Expedient, Saliba was a Senior Account Executive with NDCHealth, a publicly-traded software provider to the pharmacy industry, which was subsequently purchased by McKesson, a Fortune 50 health care services company. “David has an impressive track record in high growth situations, developing teams and providing excellent customer service. We are looking forward to him building on our consistent organic growth pattern, by implementing new strategic market initiatives and developing more partnerships in the Northeast Ohio area,” said Shawn McGorry, President & COO of Expedient, to whom Saliba will report. “The region clearly has high growth potential as evidenced by our need to expand for the seventh time. That expansion requirement has been more than matched by the increasing demand of our Cloud Computing and Managed Services platforms. We are excited to have David in Cleveland and are confident that he will continue to drive Expedient’s position as the local market leader for Infrastructure as a Service.”
