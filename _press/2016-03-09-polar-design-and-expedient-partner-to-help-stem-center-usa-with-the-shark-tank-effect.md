**Boston, MA (March 9, 2016) -** STEM Center USA, a leading K-12 education company, earned a spot on ABC’s _Shark Tank_. Working together and with only two weeks notice, Polar Design and Expedient prepared their website to withstand the traffic influx of the “Shark Tank Effect” and impress new visitors with a comprehensive design and technology solution. 

When your business involves child STEM education and robots, you can’t afford slowing down even for a moment. STEM Center USA has engaged students and parents with compelling robotics-based STEM education for nearly four years. In early October of 2015, with just a few weeks to prepare, they learned of their scheduled October 30th appearance on ABC’s _Shark Tank_. The widely known “Shark Tank Effect” brings tens of thousands of visitors to featured companies’ websites per hour and in some cases lasts weeks. Past businesses appearing on the show that did not prepare saw their web sites slow down, crash, or simply fail to impress _Shark Tank’s_ vast audience. 

STEM Center USA’s website, developed at its inception, featured an outdated look and messaging, and utilized a shared hosting service. When STEM Center USA notified Polar Design of this exciting and challenging event, they sprang into action immediately and crafted a plan to modernize the site’s look. 

“We added compelling video, and restructured the web site technology to operate across multiple servers. In partnership with Expedient, a leader in cloud hosting services, we deployed a revamped, refactored web site across three virtualized and load balanced web servers with a separate database server all in just over two weeks”, stated Mark J. Jaklovsky, Managing Director of Polar Design.

The web site’s performance skipped along without missing a beat, even during moments of the heaviest load exceeding 10,000 simultaneous visitors. 

According to Melissa Jawaharlal, the CEO and co-founder of STEM Center USA, “when \[STEM Center USA\] learned that we'd be on _Shark Tank_, one thing we knew we could relax about was our web site.  Polar Design and Expedient had plans in place to transition our site to the cloud.  We were able to rapidly, and beautifully, upgrade our site with ease. Once we pulled the trigger, we had full confidence we could enjoy reliving the moment when Sharks Lori Greiner and Chris Sacca made their offers rather than worrying about how our site would perform under the ‘Shark Tank Effect.’”
