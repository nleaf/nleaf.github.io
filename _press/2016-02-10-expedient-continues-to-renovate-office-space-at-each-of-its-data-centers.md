**Pittsburgh, PA (February, 15, 2016) -** Expedient, a leading provider of data center colocation, cloud computing and managed hosting services, recently updated its Pittsburgh office space to a more modern look further establishing consistency among all of its locations. 

This particular renovation took six months to complete and resulted in a more open, dynamic and collaborative workspace featuring more open spaces, low-profile work stations and client work areas. 

The renovation aligns the Pittsburgh office space to that of Expedient’s other recently renovated offices in Indianapolis, IN; Memphis, TN; Columbus, OH and Cleveland, OH.
