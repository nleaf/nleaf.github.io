**Pittsburgh, PA (September 8, 2015) –** Expedient has been awarded a 2015 [Top Workplaces](http://www.topworkplaces.com/frontend.php/regional-lists) honor by the _Pittsburgh Post-Gazette_. The Top Workplaces lists are based solely on the results of an employee feedback survey administered by [WorkplaceDynamics, LLC](http://www.workplacedynamics.com/), a leading research firm that specializes in organizational health and workplace improvement. Several aspects of workplace culture were measured, including Alignment, Execution and Connection, just to name a few.   

“The Top Workplaces award is not a popularity contest. And oftentimes, people assume it’s all about fancy perks and benefits,” says Doug Claffey, CEO of WorkplaceDynamics. “But to be a Top Workplace, organizations must meet our strict standards for organizational health. And who better to ask about worklife than the people who live the culture every day—the employees. Time and time again, our research has proven that what’s most important to them is a strong belief in where the organization is headed, how it’s going to get there, and the feeling that everyone is in it together. Without this sense of connection, an organization doesn’t have a shot at being named a Top Workplace.”   

“All of us at Expedient are honored to once-again be named to the Top Workplaces list,” says Shawn McGorry, President of Expedient. “We are keenly aware that the marketplace for the extremely talented people that we need in order to offer a premium IT hosting experience to our customers is very competitive. Cloud compute technology, as well as all of the underlying physical and software infrastructure, is changing so fast, that only the best and brightest IT engineers and professionals are able keep pace. We are delighted that our team members identify the Expedient workplace as satisfying, and going in the right direction.”
