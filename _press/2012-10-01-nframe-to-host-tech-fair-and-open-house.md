(Carmel, Indiana) October 1, 2012, n|Frame, leading provider of colocation, cloud computing, managed hosting services and connectivity will be hosting a Tech Fair and Open House that is open to members of the local technology community on October 11, 2012 at its Carmel, IN data center.

The Tech Fair is offered by n|Frame in response to the never-ending demand for knowledge about the latest strategies and a deep look into the future of cloud computing and its impact on the Indianapolis community of Data Centers.  “I am excited to be able to leverage our partnerships to further educate the tech community on how virtualization and the cloud will take us to the next level in compute space availability and efficiency;” commented Ray Vallillo, Regional Vice President for nFrame.   n|Frame has lined up a panel of expert speakers including VMware, Dell and a locally based disaster recovery company, The Lighthouse Readiness Group.  Each will speak on the Strategies and Technologies of the Cloud: Now and in the Future.

Earlier this summer, n|Frame announced the appointment of Mr. Vallillo as its new Regional Vice President.  Immediately following Mr. Vallillo’s appointment, the company announced plans for a significant Data Center expansion and a ½ Million Dollar investment in its next generation virtual/cloud hosting platform, which is already in place and being utilized by local firms. n|Frame is in the midst of a multi- month engineering review that will ultimately result in expansion and improvements made to their 35,000 sq. ft. data center facility.  The Indianapolis data center (n|Frame) is part of a national group of 8 data centers located in Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland (2), Columbus, and Pittsburgh (2).  All of these data centers are SSAE-18 audited and interconnected with a 10gb fiber backbone.

Guests are encouraged to RSVP for the Tech Fair, which will include lunch and engineer-chaperoned data center tours.  The event takes place October 11th from 10am- 2pm.  Registration will begin at 9:30am with presentations beginning promptly at 10am.  Please visit [http://www.nframe.com/](http://www.nframe.com/) to register, as space is limited.
