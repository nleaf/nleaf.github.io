_Pittsburgh-based Expedient's newly redesigned websit-Expedient.com-offers enhanced resources, including details of new products like virtual colocation and virtual instance. The new site features a redesigned quote form and expanded support-ticketing services, along with easier navigation._

Pittsburgh, PA - January 5, 2009 -- Managed-services provider Expedient has a new look. They are excited to showcase new products such as [Virtual Colocation](https://www.expedient.com/products/virtual-colocation.php)and Managed Virtual Instances, along with a 3D virtual tour of its second Cleveland data center. The site offers wholesale improvements over the previous version in both appearance and functionality.

Expedient's redesign improves the customer service experience by enabling them to open support tickets on the website and request a quote for a broader range of services. The redesigned quote tool provides additional options and more accurate quotes for potential customers. A 3D virtual tour of Expedient's eighth data center, Cleveland NEO 152, has also been added to the site. The video builds the facility right before your eyes and reveals the components required for an enterprise class data center. This facility provides a perfect platform for Expedient's Managed Services offerings.

"The new website is a welcome refresh," says Bryan K. Smith, Vice President, Sales and Marketing. "We are pleased to offer our potential clients and existing loyal customers better ways to find our products and solutions, including the new, up-and-coming products: Virtual Colocation and Virtual Instances. Additionally, the virtual tour of our new Cleveland data center gives potential customers a better look at one of the most advanced facilities in Ohio. We will be adding updated 3D virtual tours of all of our facilities in 2010. We've also taken the first step to boost our online support by allowing customers to open tickets. All in all, the improvements we've made should significantly enhance the site's usability, functionality, and image."

In the last year, Expedient opened two new data centers, including its second Cleveland and Pittsburgh facilities. The company intends to expand the Cleveland facility in the future, adding two more phases to the current campus and bringing the total square footage to almost 50,000.
