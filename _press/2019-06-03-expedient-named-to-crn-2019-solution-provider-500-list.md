**Pittsburgh, PA (3 June 2019) –** Expedient, a managed cloud and data center infrastructure as a service provider, today announced that CRN, a brand of The Channel Company, has named the company to its 2019 Solution Provider 500. This annual list ranks the largest North American IT channel partner organizations by revenue. The Solution Provider 500 is the industry standard for recognizing the highest performing technology integrators, strategic service providers and IT consultants. It is the industry's predominant channel partner list, serving as a valuable resource for technology vendors looking to partner with top solution providers.

This is the fifth consecutive year Expedient has been named to the SP500, and the fourth year it has ranked in the top 50% of service providers in North America. Healthy revenue growth fueled by the addition of several large enterprise accounts and increased demand for Expedient’s hosted cloud and managed services saw the company jump nearly 50 spots in the 2019 SP500 ranking to #176.

Inclusion in the SP500 is yet another accolade for Expedient in 2019, which has already been recognized on multiple CRN lists including the [Managed Services Provider 500](https://www.crn.com/news/managed-services/the-2019-managed-service-provider-500-complete-listing) and the [Tech Elite 250](https://www.crn.com/rankings-and-lists/te2019.htm). In addition to this industry-wide recognition, the cloud and data center infrastructure provider also received a prestigious partner innovation award from VMware in April when the virtualization giant [named Expedient](https://www.expedient.com/press-releases/expedient-wins-vmware-2018-regional-partner-innovation-award/) as its 2018 Americas Cloud Partner of the Year.

"Expedient’s capacity to identify and capitalize upon emerging needs in the dynamic cloud infrastructure space is a main factor of our continued revenue growth,” explained Bryan Smith, Expedient’s Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. “Our enterprise-class hybrid and multi-cloud solutions have filled a large gap in the marketplace as organizations of all types seek alternatives to the hyperscale cloud.”

“The companies on this year’s list represent an incredible combined revenue of $320 billion, a sum that attests to their success in staying ahead of rapidly changing market demands,” said Bob Skelley, CEO of The Channel Company. “Congratulations to the solution provider organizations leading the way in digital transformation and the latest technology services.” The full CRN 2019 Solution 500 list is available online at: [https://www.crn.com/sp-500/sp2019.htm](https://www.crn.com/sp-500/sp2019.htm).
