CARMEL, Ind. – Expedient Data Centers announced today the assignment of Matthew D’Eramo as its new Director of Sales for Expedient’s Indiana market. D’Eramo, a transfer from Expedient’s Columbus market, will be responsible for leading the firm’s continued business development and growth initiatives in the Indianapolis, Indiana region. Expedient used to operate the regional Indianapolis market under the brand nFrame, which it acquired in 2007. The company completed a brand name transition to Expedient Data Centers in late 2013, which is the moniker for all its other operations in the Midwest and North Atlantic regions. Expedient is in the final stages of an 18 month, $11 Million dollar expansion project at their Indianapolis facility, in response to increasing demand for more capacity for data center hosting and cloud compute services. While new to the Indianapolis market, D’Eramo is not new to the Expedient team. He began his career with the firm as part of the Pittsburgh sales team in 2009. In 2011, he accepted a promotion to help open up the company’s expansion into the Columbus, Ohio market. He spent three years helping the market grow from zero customers, to a leading position in the market, resulting in new construction of its third data center expansion. “Matt’s extensive knowledge of our company, products and services, coupled with his well-respected past performance as one of Expedient’s leading business development executives make him uniquely qualified,” said Ray Vallillo, Regional Vice President and GM of Expedient, Indiana. “I am extremely excited to become a part of the Indianapolis team and I look forward to becoming a part of the Indianapolis technology community” added D’Eramo. D’Eramo is a graduate of Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, where he obtained his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and was also captain of the wrestling team. He is recently married and plans to move to Indianapolis full time by the end of April.
