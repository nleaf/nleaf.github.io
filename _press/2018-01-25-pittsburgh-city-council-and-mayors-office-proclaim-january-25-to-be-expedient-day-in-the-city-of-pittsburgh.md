**Pittsburgh, PA (25 January 2018) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced January 25, 2018 as “Expedient Day” in Pittsburgh, as proclaimed by the Council of the City of Pittsburgh and the Office of the Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh.

On January 25, Expedient will be hosting a day-long Open House celebration to mark the public reveal of its $14.5 million, 10,000 square foot expansion of its Nova Place data center. A 4:00 pm ribbon cutting ceremony during the Open House will be attended by Pittsburgh business leaders and elected officials including Councilman Corey O’Connor, Pittsburgh City Council; Tom Link, Director of Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh; Chris Heck, President & CEO, Pittsburgh Airport Area Chamber of Commerce; Robin Rosemary Miller, Executive Director, Northside/North Shore Chamber of Commerce; Bradley Ott, Vice President Commercial Operations, Faros Properties; and Audrey Russo, President & CEO, Pittsburgh Technology Council.

The Nova Place data center expansion adds 10,000 square feet of new raised floor computer room space and cloud capacity for IaaS and disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) solutions. Several thousand additional square feet have been dedicated to fully redundant switchgear, Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems, and emergency generators with up to two megawatts of demand and fuel capacity. Additionally, the renovated and expanded facility is powered by new dedicated and redundant commercial utility power service.

The facility is one of two Expedient data centers in the Pittsburgh region. Its expansion marks Expedient’s third such undertaking in Pittsburgh in 14 years, and was one of the company’s three major expansion projects in 2017, which included an 8,000-square-foot expansion and renovation of Expedient’s Boston data center that was completed in March 2017 and a $4.5 million upgrade of its Indianapolis data center that, like Nova Place, was completed in November 2017.

Like all Expedient data centers, Nova Place offers all Expedient services from physical server colocation to public and private cloud infrastructure, and a suite of managed IT infrastructure services, along with 24x7x365 on-site support. All Expedient data centers are connected through Layer 2 network access and a multi-gigabit private fiber backbone, creating a powerful distributed presence for critical IT infrastructure services. And, all Expedient data centers offer SOC 1 (SSAE-18) and SOC 2 audit attestations, and support customers’ needs to meet PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and other industry/regulatory compliance mandates.
