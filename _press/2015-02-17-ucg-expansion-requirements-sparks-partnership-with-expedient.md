**INDEPENDENCE, OH (February 13, 2015) —** United Computer Group, Inc. (UCG), an information technology services firm, is pleased to announce the selection of Expedient Data Centers to complement and support UCG’s expanding IBM Power Systems Managed Services practice which is growing at a rate in excess of 25% per year. 

On January 26, 2015, Expedient announced the completion of their third Cleveland data center, providing data center colocation, cloud computing, and managed hosting services. In addition to Cleveland, Expedient currently operates in seven cities; Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Memphis, Columbus, Baltimore, and Boston. 

The partnership between UCG and Expedient developed organically during discussions between David Saliba, Regional Vice President, Expedient, and James Kandrac, CEO, United Computer Group. Kandrac stated, “Both firms realized we had some overlap in clients, but provided different yet complimentary cloud-based services. Working together, we’ve developed a cohesive approach in response to client requirements. Expedient is a first class operation, which further enhances UCG’s data presence nationwide, providing UCG access to Expedient services and the ability to provide IBM Power P8 Servers (PROD, TEST, DEV, BaaS, DR and H/A), storage, and managed services to 11 Expedient data centers in seven markets.” 

“We are very excited to be partnering with United Computer Group as this allows us to provide additional value to our customers that have a need for iSeries,” said Saliba. “We look forward to working together as we help customers with their infrastructure, allowing them more time to focus on their business critical applications.”
