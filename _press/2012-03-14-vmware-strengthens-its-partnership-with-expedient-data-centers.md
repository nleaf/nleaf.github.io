March 13, 2012 (Columbus, Ohio) VMware has always had a great relationship with Expedient and over the last twelve months it has become even stronger. Most recently, VMware has begun to co-locate their test lab equipment that they use for customer demos and internal training at the Expedient data center in Columbus. VMware has their Ohio-based systems engineers log in to their lab environment and conduct proof-of-concept evaluations and training for potential clients. “This allows us to be able to run tests and demo options right from within the Expedient data center where other companies are hosting their critical information”, states Thomas MacKay - VCP, CNE, Master ASE & Staff Systems Engineer at VMware.

VMware has seen tremendous benefits of co-locating at the Expedient data center. “When we were choosing a data center, Expedient came to the front of our mind especially since they are a national VMware partner. We like to work with companies that support us on the national and local levels. The fact that Expedient guarantees 100% uptime was really the cherry on top and allows us the ability to focus on our customer use cases and training without worry of downtime,” MacKay states.

In Central Ohio, Expedient hosts the monthly VMware User Group meetings at their Upper Arlington Data Center. It has given both organizations the opportunity to meet hundreds of IT professionals in the Columbus community and allows the two groups the ability to educate hundreds of businesses in becoming more effective and efficient with their technology. Expedient enjoys hosting these events as it is an excellent outlet to showcase their world-class data center.
