**Pittsburgh, PA. (4 March 2019)** **—** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced that [CRN**®**](http://www.crn.com), a brand of [The Channel Company](http://www.thechannelco.com/), has named Expedient to its [2019 Managed Service Provider 500 list](https://www.crn.com/news/managed-services/the-2019-managed-service-provider-500-complete-listing?itc=refresh#security). This annual list recognizes the top technology providers and consultants in North America whose forward-thinking approach to providing managed services is changing the landscape of the IT channel.

Expedient was named to the Security 100 portion of the list, which recognizes managed services providers with particular strength in off-premises cloud-based security services.

Expedient’s appearance on the Managed Service Provider 500 list is attributable to its leading-edge developments in managed services, including its Push Button DR solution, which leverages software-defined networking to enable seamless entire-network failover from one location to another with a single push of a button.

“It’s an honor to once again be recognized on the CRN Managed Service Provider 500 list,” said Shawn McGorry, President and Chief Operating Officer of Expedient. “Managed services continues to be the primary growth driver for Expedient, and we saw managed services revenues nearly double in 2018. As more clients move workloads to our cloud, they find strategic benefits to subscribing to our managed services, freeing them to focus on innovating their businesses.”
