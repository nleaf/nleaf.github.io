**Pittsburgh, PA (September 15, 2016) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service provider (IaaS), announced today that it is initiating an expansion project at one of its Pittsburgh, PA data centers, located at Nova Place, formerly known as Allegheny Center Mall. The facility is one of two enterprise data centers the company operates in the region. The project, scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 2016, will build new data center space contiguous to its existing space, and when complete, will effectively double the power, environmental and raised floor computer room capacity at the location, while also creating a larger shared lobby, operations support center (OSC) and client convenience area. 

Originally commissioned by Expedient in 2008, the facility featured 10,000 square feet of raised floor computer room space. A project completed in 2012 further increased computer room capacity to 18,000 square feet. The new project, representing a $14M capital investment, will create conditioned space for more than 385 additional colocation cabinets to host both physical and virtual cloud computing platforms. The total available raised floor computer room space will grow to 28,000 square feet. 

“Our team is excited about the new opportunities that expansion represents and we’ve enjoyed a lot of it for the past several years including our two most recent builds in Columbus, OH and Memphis, TN last year,” remarked Shawn McGorry, President and COO of Expedient. 

The expansion and renovation is scheduled to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017 and will include the following, primary features:

* New, dedicated and redundant commercial utility power service
* Fully redundant switchgear, uninterruptable power supply (UPS) systems and emergency generators with up to two (2) Megawatts of demand, and fuel capacity to operate for extended periods of time
* Next generation computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units to increase efficiency
* Larger operations support center (OSC) with space to accommodate new employees
* Additional public and private cloud computing services including disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS)
* Layer 2 network access and a multi-gigabit interconnection among all eleven (11) Expedient data centers

The existing data center facility will remain continuously operational throughout the duration of the project—all new critical infrastructure will be dedicated to the expansion. Visitor access will be adjusted at various times during the project to facilitate construction in the lobby area.
