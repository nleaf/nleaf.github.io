Memphis, TN, November 10, 2014 – Expedient Data Centers (Expedient), a national leader in colocation, managed hosting and cloud computing services, announced today the appointment of Jim Kothe to the position of Regional Vice President to oversee its expansion into the Memphis, Tennessee market. The company just recently announced plans to make Memphis its 7th market and will open its 11th Data Center there in June of 2015, upon completion of facility improvements including an initial $5 million dollar capital investment. As Regional Vice President for Expedient’s newest market, Kothe will first be focused on building a local team of highly skilled technology professionals and establishing strategic relationships with other technology leaders in Memphis. Expedient is dedicated to becoming the trusted IT advisor as area firms evaluate and consider the best alternatives for outsourcing their technology infrastructure. In Memphis, Kothe will bring the full technical, managerial and financial backing that all Expedient markets deliver to customers. Expedient’s full suite of cloud and hosting services on top of a recently upgraded Tier 3 data center provides companies with a reliable environment and economical solution for hosting their business-critical applications. “Expedient enjoys a thought leadership position in all of the markets we currently serve, and I look forward to providing that level of service to business and other organizations in the Memphis community,” stated Kothe. Since joining Expedient in 2013 as Director of Special Projects, Kothe has successfully led multiple initiatives to scale the organization’s service delivery capabilities, resulting in more consistent customer experiences and faster project completion. He brings more than 15 years of relevant experience to this role, having previously served as Associate Partner - Managed Services & Hosting and Vice President of Technology Services for Rosetta (which has since been acquired by the customer engagement agency Publicis Groupe), where he facilitated infrastructure platforms for a wide range of customer engagements. In his most recent venture as the President of a start-up call tracking company, he oversaw an increase in both revenue and profitability of more than one hundred percent within two years. Kothe, his wife and two children, are looking forward to establishing permanent residence in the Memphis area in early 2015. “Jim has a proven track record of growing sales, developing teams and providing excellent customer service. His firsthand experience working side by side with our operations teams has prepared him well for this opportunity and to bring our highly demanded product offerings and tailored solutions to Memphis. We are confident that Jim will work quickly to establish Expedient as a quality IT Service Provider to the greater Memphis area,” said Shawn McGorry, COO of Expedient. Expedient has already begun recruiting for sales and engineering positions in the Memphis market and encourages interested parties to apply on the company’s web site www.expedient.com. Kothe will establish full time residency just after the first of the year. Meanwhile, many members of the Expedient management have been and will continue to be in Memphis on a regular basis laying the groundwork for full time operations in January 2015.
