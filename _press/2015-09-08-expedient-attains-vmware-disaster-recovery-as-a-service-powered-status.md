**Pittsburgh, PA (September 8, 2015) –** Expedient today announced that its Virtual Colocation public cloud service has attained VMware Disaster Recovery as a Service™ (DRaaS) Powered status. A member of the VMware vCloud® Air™ Network Program, Expedient will offer DRaaS that drastically simplifies a disaster scenario with their exclusively branded Push Button DR solution.

A disaster recovery plan enables organizations to have peace of mind that potential downtime and loss of data resulting from a natural disaster or equipment failure can be minimized. Organizations that want to minimize the costs of infrastructure and software needed for a secondary or tertiary disaster recovery site can utilize Expedient’s public cloud as recovery infrastructure. By using Virtual Colocation, firms can save by using a subscription-based service instead of making capital investments into physical infrastructure. 

VMware DRaaS Powered status also enables organizations to quickly search for and identify service providers who provide disaster recovery services based on VMware technology. 

VMware DRaaS Powered status is backed by VMware vCenter™ Site Recovery Manager™, the industry-leading solution that enables application availability and mobility across sites in private cloud environments. VMware vCenter Site Recovery Manager is an automation solution that operates with an underlying replication technology to provide policy-based management, non-disruptive testing and automated orchestration of recovery plans. This provides simple and reliable recovery of virtual machines between sites with minimal or no downtime. 

“Businesses continue to shift applications to the cloud. In doing so, they are looking to increase availability and maintain stability of their critical applications. Push Button DR provides customers with a fully automated and orchestrated server and network failover that reduces recovery time from days to hours,” said Shawn McGorry, Expedient's President and Chief Operating Officer. 

“Organizations continue to seek ways to protect their operations from downtime and loss of data. With more applications, systems, and data to protect than ever before, having a disaster recovery plan in place is important,” said Jim Aluotto, director, vCloud Air Network Service Provider Business, Americas Region, VMware. “We are pleased that Expedient has attained VMware DRaaS Powered status, and look forward to our continued collaboration.” 

Expedient sought VMware DRaaS Powered status in order to help ease consumers’ minds as they shift to cloud based resources to satisfy their Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity objectives. As a VMware vCloud Air Network Service Provider, Expedient can now provide users with enhanced responsiveness and agility, and enable reduced IT costs through greater performance, availability and scalability.
