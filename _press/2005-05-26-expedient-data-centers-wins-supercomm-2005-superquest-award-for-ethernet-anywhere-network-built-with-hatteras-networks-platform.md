Expedient Data Centers Independently Recognized for Delivering Innovative Business Services utilizing Hatteras Networks' Carrier-Grade Ethernet Solution

(RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC - MAY 26, 2005) - Hatteras Networks, the leader in standards-based, high-bandwidth, symmetrical, last-mile Ethernet over bonded copper access and service platforms, announced today that Expedient Data Centers has been honored by SUPERCOMM with a SUPERQuest Award in the "Network Design and Services" category. Expedient's Ethernet Anywhere™ service offers flexible, high-performance Ethernet services over last-mile copper and metro fiber. Now being offered in select cities nationwide, Expedient plans to expand the Ethernet Anywhere network to 30 markets across the country over the next 12 - 18 months.

"Hatteras Networks has been a tremendous partner for Expedient as we've expanded our Ethernet Anywhere network to now service businesses connected with copper, and the SUPERQuest award is a testament to what two companies can do when you combine superior technology with innovative, market-leading services," said Mark McGinness, Vice President of Expedient Data Centers. "We look forward to rolling the Ethernet Anywhere service out throughout all of our markets to give business customers the first true, high-performance, flexible alternative to existing private line services."

Expedient announced in October 2004 that it had selected Hatteras Networks' Ethernet bonded copper access solutions for its Ethernet over copper roll-out, complementing Expedient's existing fiber-based metro deployments. At SUPERCOMM 2004, Hatteras Networks' Metro Ethernet Copper Access™ platform, on which Expedient's Ethernet Anywhere network resides, was selected as the Most Promising Networking Technology in the Access Networking Equipment category. Over the last eight years, SUPERQuest Award recipients have been selected as the best of the best in creating the most innovative new technologies and products for supplying the best new enterprise solutions.

"Expedient is taking each market they enter by storm with the Ethernet Anywhere services and we're pleased to be an integral part of their continuing success," said Kevin Sheehan, President and CEO of Hatteras Networks. "Expedient continues to deliver on the promise of carrier-grade Ethernet services by deploying highly flexible internet, voice and managed services to nearly any business, anywhere over existing copper facilities."

According to TIA President Matthew J. Flanigan, "Each year at SUPERCOMM, hundreds of technology companies exhibit and demonstrate industry-leading products and services. Of those companies, there are a handful that embody the highest degree of innovation in our field. It is those companies that we honor with the SUPERQuest Awards."

Expedient representatives will be on hand in Hatteras Networks' booth, #29049, at SUPERCOMM 2005, to discuss their network and answer questions about how they are using Hatteras Networks' platform to create robust business-grade services over copper. Hatteras Networks will also demonstrate how carriers can deliver point-to-point and multipoint 2BASE-TL bonded copper solutions, with voice, video and data over a single connection - all with unique service level agreements.
