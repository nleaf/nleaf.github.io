**Pittsburgh, PA (20 March 2017) –** Expedient, a cloud computing and data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider, today announced that [CRN](http://www.crn.com/), a brand of [The Channel Company](http://www.thechannelco.com/), has named Expedient to its 2017 Data Center 100 list as a Top 20 Data Center Provider. 

The annual list recognizes top providers of leading-edge, flexible, and cost-effective data center services such as co-location, managed hosting, cloud hosting and disaster recovery. CRN editors select companies for the Data Center 100 list based on multiple criteria, including each company’s overall impact on the market, its influence on the channel, and the types of technology and services it offers to its partners. 

CRN develops the list in part to serve as a valuable guide for solution providers seeking best-in-class vendors providing a variety of IaaS services, including data backup, virtual data center solutions, and cloud hosting solutions, among others. 

Expedient’s position on the list is attributable to its 11 state-of-the-art data center facilities in Boston, Baltimore (2), Cleveland (2), Columbus (2), Indianapolis, Memphis, and Pittsburgh (2). All of Expedient’s data centers are interconnected with at least a 10Gbps private fiber backbone and feature 24x7x365 on-site support. 

“We’re honored to earn this coveted recognition from CRN for the fifth consecutive year, especially on the heels of our record-breaking growth in 2016,” said Shawn McGorry, President and Chief Operating Officer of Expedient. “Our momentum continues in 2017, with the March opening of an 8,000-square-foot expansion in our Boston data center, a 4,000-square-foot renovation and expansion in our Indianapolis facility, and the $14 million, 10,000-square-foot expansion of one of our two Pittsburgh data centers. These expansions enable us to continue to provide leading-edge solutions to our customers, freeing them to focus on their business’ more strategic needs – and their bottom line.” 

The Data Center 100 list is featured in the February 2017 issue of CRN and online at [http://www.crn.com/news/data-center/300083932/the-2017-data-center-100.htm](http://www.crn.com/news/data-center/300083932/the-2017-data-center-100.htm).
