**Pittsburgh, PA (February 14, 2014) —** Expedient, a leading provider of colocation, cloud computing, managed hosting and internet-related connectivity services, today announced that it has been recognized in the [CRN](http://www.crn.com/) Data Center 100 annual list as a top 20 Data Center Provider. This list features technology vendors whose solutions are vital for powering today's data center. CRN developed the list to help solution providers navigate the marketplace and identify the top companies and technologies among the data center provider sector, to best meet their needs as they build solutions for their customers.

Identified by the editorial staff, the vendors featured on this list power, support and protect today's data center services from data backup tools to virtual data center solutions and cloud hosting services, while boosting efficiency and productivity.

The list honors vendors in five different data center technology categories: Infrastructure, Tools, Virtualization, Service Providers and Designers and Builders.

Expedient was selected for this list, for the second time as a result of their ever-expanding portfolio of state-of-the-art data centers. They currently have nine (9) facilities in the following cities: Boston, Baltimore (2), Cleveland (2), Columbus, Indianapolis and Pittsburgh (2). All of Expedient's data centers are interconnected with a 10Gbps private fiber backbone and feature 24x7x365 on-site support. This year, Expedient has four (4) expansions planned in Cleveland, Columbus, Pittsburgh and Indianapolis, which would bring their total footprint to over 250,000 sq. ft.

"The Data Center 100 list recognizes vendors that embrace innovation, efficiency and sustainability, to bring the data center to the next level," said Robert Faletra, CEO, The Channel Company. "These dynamic companies are led by forward-thinking executives who understand today's data center environment. We applaud their success and look forward to their continued contributions to this industry."

"We are very honored to accept this award, especially after finishing another record customer growth year here at Expedient," states Bryan Smith, Regional Vice President. "With a dedicated staff of technical support personnel in all of our local markets, an innovative product development team and our tireless facilities engineering team, we are able to stay ahead of our customer's demand curve, whether it be for traditional data center hosting or valued added managed services. We expect 2014 to be another record year, especially for our growing cloud computing platform, which accounted for more than 40% of our product growth in 2013."
