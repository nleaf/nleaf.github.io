Expedient held its annual Cleveland Tech Fair on September 25, 2008. The Tech Fair included the unveiling of its new data center expansion and featured presentations by Kevin McCarthy from VMWare and Chris Rauch from EMC2. Prior to the presentations lunch was provided by local BBQ favorite, BubbaQ's.

Expedient invested over $2 million dollars into the Garfield Heights data center expansion facility in the last year. Upgrades consist of adding 3,800 sq. ft. of data center space and an additional 90 tons of cooling to the 450 tons already in place. The improvements also provided raised floor and FM-200 fire suppression.

Before these recent upgrades the facility already boasted four redundant UPS's, 450 tons of HVAC, FM-200 fire suppression, dual diesel generators producing 2.5 Megawatts of power, video camera surveillance, key card entrance, and lockable cabinets.

The Cleveland data center is connected with Expedient's other nine data centers via 10Gbps, long-haul fiber optic rings. This provides direct access to multiple Tier 1 providers, a high availability network including firewalls and load balancers, and on-site engineers and a Network Operating Center to provide premier support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

More than 100 participants joined Expedient outside its Garfield Heights facility for BBQ and presentations before touring the newly expanded data center.
