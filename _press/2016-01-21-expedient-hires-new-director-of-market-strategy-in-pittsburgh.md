**Pittsburgh,PA (January 21, 2016) -** Expedient, a leading provider of data center colocation, cloud computing and managed hosting services, hires David Birks as Director of Market Strategy for their Pittsburgh market. 

Birks has 29 years of experience in the greater Western PA information technology industry with a proven track record for establishing long-term, successful client relationships. In his previous position as Director of Sales at Compu-Fix, a Pittsburgh-based IT support services company, Birks was instrumental in tripling the company’s revenue during his 25-year tenure. 

“Having worked with Expedient as one of their vendors since 1999, I have seen the responsible growth and the commitment to excellence across all phases of the organization,” Birks says. “It was this enterprise-wide approach, strong, stable leadership and effusive customer loyalty that I found so compelling.” 

As the Director of Market Strategy for Expedient, Birks will be responsible for spearheading new partnerships and community involvement through the greater Pittsburgh area and beyond. 

“We know David is uniquely qualified for this new position and we are happy to have him on board,” says David Saliba, Regional Vice President of Expedient Pittsburgh. “His longstanding career and reputation in the IT community will be a benefit to the company and our customers.” 

In addition to Birks’ new role, Devon Cole also moved into a new position with Expedient, now serving as the Regional Account Manager working with the current customer base. Cole previously served as a Project Manager with the service delivery team.
