Together, ANET and Expedient will offer customers business class data center options that stretch across the country via facilities with more than 200 employees in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Baltimore, South Florida, Boston, San Francisco and Richmond, Virginia. These facilities enable co-location and a variety of managed services including seamless multi-city business continuity, remote city data backup and disaster recovery planning.

The merger will bring these services along with an expanded range of high-bandwidth data network connectivity options including Ethernet Anywhere, a leading edge, scalable connectivity solution that takes established Ethernet technology and extends it beyond the LAN environment into a WAN.

Charlie Watkins, President and CEO of Continental Broadband explains the significance of this merger, "Expedient and ANET combined offer one of the strongest connectivity options for businesses in the Midwest. This merger melds ANET into one of the country's largest and most reliable connectivity solutions. ANET will be transformed by this merger. We're glad to bring this class of service where we are confident the business community will benefit from the leading edge technology brought to the table by Expedient."

In support of its expanded capabilities, ANET will add to its data center at 216 West Jackson and is likely to, in the near-term, add additional facility sites downtown and in the suburbs. New facilities, in addition to the expanded services offered through Expedient, will make ANET one of the Midwest's largest providers of business-class connectivity and managed data solutions. ANET is also going to name a new general manager.

Both ANET and Expedient are part of Continental Broadband, which is wholly owned by Landmark Communications.
