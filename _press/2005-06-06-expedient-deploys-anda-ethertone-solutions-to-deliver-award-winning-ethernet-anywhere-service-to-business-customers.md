ANDA Provides an Easy, Cost-Effective Migration Path for Convergence of All Services Over a Simple Ethernet Interface

ANDA Networks, the leader in carrier-class solutions for fiber and copper-based access networks, today announced that Expedient is deploying ANDA EtherTone solutions for its new award-winning Ethernet Anywhere service that provides scalable, cost-effective Ethernet services for mission-critical business networks. Expedient's Ethernet Anywhere service uses ANDA's award-winning carrier-class EtherEdge 4000 aggregation platforms and EtherReach 2000 series access products to cost-effectively provide businesses bandwidth-on-demand from 5Mbps to 40Mbps using a simple low-cost Ethernet interface.

ANDA's EtherTone solutions allow Expedient's Ethernet Anywhere service to deliver one integrated connection that can be used to carry high-speed Internet traffic and securely segment private point-to-point connections for applications such as VoIP, video conferencing, and secure e-mail and file sharing in scalable increments of bandwidth up to 40Mbps. By consolidating the circuits over one easy-to-use Ethernet connection, customers can reduce their monthly expenses by up to seventy-five 75% with a service that's more flexible, and less expensive than traditional private line networking solutions. Recently, Expedient's Ethernet Anywhere service has been awarded SUPERQuest's Network Design and Service Award announced this week at Supercomm 2005.

"As more and more customers adopt Ethernet packet-based services, ANDA is critical to our network strategy," said Mark McGinness, Vice President of Business Development for Expedient. "ANDA's products provide such advantages as cost-effective scalable bandwidth, quicker provisioning, and ultimately allows us to reach both on-net and off-net customers with carrier-class performance."

ANDA enables Expedient to offer Ethernet-based services over existing copper, SONET, and dark fiber networks. Expedient can now leverage its existing TDM network equipment without expensive forklift upgrades through common Ethernet interfaces that provide scalable bandwidth options and allow for rapid deployment in weeks versus months.

"We're excited to see growing business customer adoption for new Ethernet service offerings and also pleased to see industry recognition of Expedient's innovative new Ethernet Anywhere service," said Charles Kenmore, President and CEO of ANDA Networks. "By deploying our solutions with Expedient, ANDA continues to reinforce its leadership in providing carrier-class Ethernet access and aggregation products and support, while helping Expedient to realize a rapid return on investment."

The EtherTone solutions provide cost-effective aggregation switching and cross connect for consolidating Managed Ethernet Private line, Transparent LAN, and SAN connections for business customers requiring a simple Ethernet interface at the customer premise with connection into the Packet Switched Network.
