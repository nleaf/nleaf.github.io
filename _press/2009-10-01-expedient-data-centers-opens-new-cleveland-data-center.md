Cleveland, Ohio - October 1, 2009 - Expedient Data Centers announced today the completion of construction on its eighth Data Center facility which will be open to customers on October 16, 2009.

Expedient's new facility will provide local and national companies with the ideal environment for hosting their business critical applications, enabling them to increase the availability of their companies' data. The perfect computing environment is a balance of redundant power, cooling, network connectivity and high level of security.

The new facility, NEO 152, a nine(9) month, multi-million dollar project, was necessary because Expedient sold out the capacity at their existing Cleveland facility nearly two years ahead of schedule. "We have had a constant demand for space since we opened our first Cleveland data center in December of 2006 and even with the shift in the economy, the demand has remained constant but the customer profile has changed somewhat", states Bryan Smith, Vice President of Sales and Marketing.

Expedient continues to be a leader in the industry as the new facility will provide them with the capacity to meet the demand for data center space in northern Ohio and is an ideal platform for their managed service offerings. These services allow the customer to focus on their business critical applications and not worry about the environment where they are housed. Expedient's new facility will be one of the most advanced facilities in Ohio as they have technology deployed within the electrical and cooling system that is not found anywhere else in the region.

The Data Center will comply with several industry certifications including an SSAE-18 audit and PCI-DSS (a financial certification for secure processing of credit card information).Other features of the new facility include; a 24x7x365 Operations Support Center (OSC), which will initially employ six additional engineers, and eventually will grow to ten total. The OSC is responsible for maintaining and monitoring various businesses' colocation, managed services and connectivity services and ensuring the tiered security methods are enforced so the customers can rest assured that their data is safe.

Expedient has growth and more expansion on the horizon, as the new data center was pre-engineered to accommodate two more phases to the current campus. Smith states, "As we sell out our space here, we are ready to begin work on the next phases, bringing our Cleveland Data Center Campus to nearly 50,000 square feet."

"Companies can benefit from working with an organization such as ours because we give them access to an extremely robust computing environment that is not economically feasible for most companies to build on their own", says Smith. "By using an Expedient data center, they also have somebody onsite 24x7x365 to assist with any of their technical needs, which further increase the availability of their data, that is the ultimate goal."
