**Pittsburgh, PA (February 9, 2015) –** Expedient Data Centers, national provider of colocation, cloud, managed services, and connectivity, announced that it has been recognized in The Channel Company’s annual CRN Data Center 100 list, featuring technology vendors whose solutions are vital to today’s data centers. Selected by the CRN editorial staff after months of in‐depth research and nominations from solution providers, each vendor on the Data Center 100 list is recognized for providing channel partners with an opportunity to grow their business by offering cutting‐edge products and services to their customers. 

The companies included in CRN’s Data Center 100 list were chosen based on a variety of criteria, including the types of technology and services they make available to partners as well as their overall impact on the market and the channel. This year’s list honors vendors in five data center technology categories: Infrastructure Providers, Tool Providers, Virtualization Vendors, Service Providers, and Designers and Builders.

Expedient was selected to the CRN Data Center 100 list for the third year in a row as a result of their ever-expanding portfolio of state-of-the-art data centers. They currently have twelve (12) facilities in the following cities: Boston, Baltimore (2), Cleveland (3), Columbus (2), Indianapolis, Memphis and Pittsburgh (2). All of Expedient’s data centers are interconnected with a 10Gbps private fiber backbone and feature 24x7x365 on-site support. In late 2014, they announced the entrance into a new market in Memphis, TN in addition to a brand new facility in Dublin, Oh, the completion of a third data center in Cleveland, Oh and an expansion in the Indianapolis data center as well.

“The Data Center 100 list focuses on the contributions of those vendors whose technologies enable the channel partner community to strategically and profitably drive greater innovation, efficiency and productivity in the data center,” said Robert Faletra, CEO, The Channel Company. “At the helm of these leading-edge companies are forward-thinking executives who are envisioning and architecting the data centers of tomorrow. We applaud their accomplishments and anticipate their continued contributions to our dynamic industry.” 

“We are very honored to accept this award, especially after finishing another record customer growth year here at Expedient,” states Bryan Smith, Regional Vice President. “With a dedicated staff of technical support personnel in all of our local markets, an innovative product development team and our tireless facilities engineering team, we are able to stay ahead of our customer’s demand curve, whether it be for traditional data center hosting or valued added managed services. We expect 2015 to be another record year, especially for our growing cloud computing platform, which accounted for more than 40% of our product growth in 2014.”
