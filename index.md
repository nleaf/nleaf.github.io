  featured_intro: Your enterprise workloads and applications are ready for a migration
    to the cloud, but a move to a hyperscale cloud provider requires your teams to
    learn entirely new platforms, demands potential refactoring of your applications,
    and doesn’t provide you with the inherent security and white-glove managed services
    you need to keep your business risk-free and running.
