featured_intro: Your enterprise workloads and applications are ready for a migration
  to the cloud, but a move to a hyperscale cloud provider requires your teams to learn
  entirely new platforms, demands potential refactoring of your applications, and
  doesn’t provide you with the inherent security and white-glove managed services
  you need to keep your business risk-free and running.
