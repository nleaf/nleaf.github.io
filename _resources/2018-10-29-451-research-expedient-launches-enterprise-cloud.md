Expedient has launched its Enterprise Cloud service offering - based on a full-suite of VMware vCloud hosted private cloud - and associated managed services. This follows the 2017 launch of its NSX-based Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS), which effectively eliminated the need to perform DNS handoffs and lowered recovery time to minutes in some cases.
