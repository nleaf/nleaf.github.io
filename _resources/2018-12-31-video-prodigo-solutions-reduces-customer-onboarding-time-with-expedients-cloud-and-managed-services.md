As a healthcare supply chain software startup, Prodigo Solutions' lean in-house technical operations group was challenged by keeping up with the escalating demands of the business and its growing number of large customers. To scale its business, the Prodigo IT team knew it needed an infrastructure partner with turnkey service capabilities and top-tier technical expertise. Prodigo turned to Expedient to gain the agility it needed, dramatically reducing customer onboarding time from weeks to days, and adding resiliency to its business through the addition of DRaaS capabilities.
