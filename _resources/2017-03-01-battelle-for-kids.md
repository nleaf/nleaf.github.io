    description: To deliver its software solutions to educators, Battelle for Kids
      must have a reliable IT infrastructure that can handle the variable demand of
      the educational system. The organization wanted to move from purchasing its
      own hardware through capital expenditures to paying for managed services through
      operational expenses.
