As one of the most-used library systems in the nation, Columbus Metropolitan Library has more than 650,000 cardholders who rely upon it for a variety of services and resources. With an in-house infrastructure approaching end of life and an outdated disaster recovery plan, CML's Information Technology team knew it was time for some changes. After a rigorous evaluation process, the team made the decision to move its infrastructure to an Expedient cloud and implement Push Button DR to ensure continuous availability of its critical applications and mitigate risk in the event of a disaster.
