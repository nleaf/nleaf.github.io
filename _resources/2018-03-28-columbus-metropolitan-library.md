    description: Columbus Metropolitan Library’s Information Technology team, led
      by Senior Director of IT, Burton Bardus, knew it was time for some changes.
      The library’s infrastructure, including its entire production environment, was
      in-house at the library data center and approaching end-of-life.

    description: CML’s disaster recovery plan was outdated and hadn’t recently been
      put through the rigors of full testing, while the team lacked confidence in
      its ability to recover critical applications in the face of a disaster. And
      with more than 650,000 cardholders relying on CML for a variety of services
      and resources, it was imperative to find a stable solution for its undersized
      infrastructure and moderate disaster recovery plan.

    headline: The Solution
    description: "“We looked very briefly at a rebuild, but there were a lot of things
      that made sense about moving to the cloud,” said Bardus. “We were able to expand
      everything we were doing with the Expedient partnership, including having a
      retention policy in place that allowed our files to be backed up while expanding
      what we were putting in our storage environment by moving to a disk-based backup
      solution.”"
