TIC Gums is using Expedient’s On-Site Private Cloud with Disaster Recovery as a Service to meet several business objectives, including the modernization and migration of its IT infrastructure and the creation and implementation of a disaster recovery plan and solution. By placing an Expedient private cloud point of delivery (POD) on-site at TIC Gums’ premises, TIC Gums is able to ensure continuous business operations through a “lift and shift” phased workload migration approach.
