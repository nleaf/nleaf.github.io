SongMeanings is a licensed music and lyrics website composed of a community of thousands of music lovers who contribute lyrics, discuss interpretations and connect over songs and artists they love, featuring more than a million lyrics from various artists, record labels and copyright owners. After hosting the website for 13 years, SongMeanings grew to a size that required colocating. With 30 million page views a month, finding a place to reliably host their servers with guaranteed uptime was a priority in their search for a hosting partner.
