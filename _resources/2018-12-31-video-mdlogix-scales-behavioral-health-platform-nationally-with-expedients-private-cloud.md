To accommodate its growth and advance its goal of the national adoption of its BH-Works platform, mdLogix required a cloud infrastructure that was both scalable and highly available, ensuring that it was accessible to health screeners when and where it was needed. And because of the sensitive behavioral data being collected and aggregated by the tool, mdLogix needed a partner who could safeguard patient health information and provide attestations to ensure compliance with HIPAA. It found all of that, and more, with Expedient's private cloud.
