  header: Deliver Innovative Customs Solutions on a Global Scale
  description: For more than 100 years, Shapiro has been developing innovative supply
    chain and customs brokerage solutions for organizations ranging from traditional
    commercial importers and exporters in the retail, pharmaceutical, consumer goods,
    and commodities industries to online sellers importing and exporting through third-party
    fulfillment services. Among Shapiro's key differentiators are its commitment to
    customs compliance, its tailored operating procedures, its in-house IT team team
    - which has developed and maintains the best-of-breed Shapiro 360 business intelligence
    application - and the direct access all Shapiro customers have to company owner
    Margie Shapiro, whose commitment to technology infrastructure investment has set
    Shapiro apart in a rapidly changing industry.

    headline: The Scenario
    description: Shapiro's in-house IT team had been managing its own data centers,
      which was a drain on bandwidth and resources, especially as the team is also
      responsible for the development, management, and continued optimization of Shapiro
      360°, which handles a large majority of day-to-day functions for the company.

    headline: The Challenge
    description: In addition to a private cloud solution, Shapiro also needed a robust,
      one-touch disaster recovery solution – preferably in a shared consumption model
      for cost-efficiency – and a compliance-forward solutions provider who was mindful
      of data security and dedicated to staying ahead of evolving government and industry
      compliance regulations.

    headline: The Solution
    description: 'Expedient’s Push Button DR solution did something no other provider
      could offer: complete network failover at the push of a button, without any
      IP or DNS changes. This was possible thanks to Expedient’s use of VMware NSX
      to create a software-defined networking layer between geographically diverse
      production and backup sites.'
