To accommodate a massive business transformation -- the deployment of mobile field services, putting 2,600 tablets into the hands of technicians across the country -- Stanley Steemer's mission critical applications required more capacity and the highest levels of availability. As Stanley Steemer sought to move its existing physical infrastructure to a completely virtual environment and add disaster recovery as a service to ensure business continuity, it turned to Expedient for its technical expertise, single-step disaster recovery solution, and local operations in close proximity to Stanley Steemer's headquarters.
