  header: Optimize the Healthcare Supply Chain Process
  description: Spun out of the University of Pittsburgh’s Medical Center (UPMC) in
    July 2014 to enable healthcare providers to optimize spend and supply chain processes
    via contract automation, Prodigo Solutions, Inc. now counts some of the nation’s
    leading hospitals as its customers. The software provider develops solutions that
    address several acute challenges in healthcare procurement such as contract management,
    contract compliance, request & purchase order management, and automation of digital
    supply chain transactions. The utility of Prodigo’s solutions is especially attractive
    to the largest-scale integrated delivery network (IDNs) in the country, as Prodigo
    counts more than 20% of these massive healthcare systems as customers.

    headline: The Challenge
    description: Prodigo’s biggest challenge was the time it took to onboard new clients;
      the existing infrastructure provider’s legacy data center environment hindered
      Prodigo’s onboarding process, as it often required months of work to launch
      each new customer deployment.

    headline: The Solution
    description: Once Prodigo made the decision to virtualize its data center using
      VMware, Bollinger knew he wanted a cloud services provider with demonstrated
      experience supported by proven processes and procedures. Prodigo began its evaluation
      with several hyperscale cloud providers, but ultimately didn’t like the one-size-fits-all
      nature of hyperscale offerings.

As a healthcare supply chain software startup, Prodigo Solutions' lean in-house technical operations group was challenged by keeping up with the escalating demands of the business and its growing number of large customers. To scale its business, the Prodigo IT team knew it needed an infrastructure partner with turnkey service capabilities and top-tier technical expertise. Prodigo turned to Expedient to gain the agility it needed, dramatically reducing customer onboarding time from weeks to days, and adding resiliency to its business through the addition of DRaaS capabilities.
