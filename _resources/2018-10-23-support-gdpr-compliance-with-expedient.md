The General Data Protection Regulation (effective May 2018) is a law designed to strengthen the data protection rights of individuals within the European Union (EU). GDPR applies not only to businesses located in the EU, but also to businesses that offer goods and services to individuals located in the EU. Expedient's suite of security solutions including backups and disaster recovery as a service, span the spectrum of GDPR accountability and compliance requirements.
