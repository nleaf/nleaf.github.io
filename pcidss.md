#### What is PCI DSS Compliance?

The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council (SSC) is an industry forum for the ongoing management of security standards for account data protection. The PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) provides an actionable framework for developing a robust payment card security process – including prevention, detection and appropriate reaction to security incidents.

#### Ensuring PCI DSS compliance for your organization

Organizations considered to be a Covered Entity include: health care providers, health plans, and health information clearinghouses that process health care information. A Covered Entity must be able to demonstrate HIPAA compliance. Further, third parties providing business services to Covered Entities must provide reasonable assurances that they will appropriately safeguard ePHI.
