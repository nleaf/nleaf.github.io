  description: Spun out of the University of Pittsburgh’s Medical Center (UPMC) in
    July 2014 to enable healthcare providers to optimize spend and supply chain processes
    via contract automation, Prodigo Solutions, Inc. now counts some of the nation’s
    leading hospitals as its customers. The software provider develops solutions that
    address several acute challenges in healthcare procurement such as contract management,
    contract compliance, request & purchase order management, and automation of digital
    supply chain transactions. The utility of Prodigo’s solutions is especially attractive
    to the largest-scale integrated delivery network (IDNs) in the country, as Prodigo
    counts more than 20% of these massive healthcare systems as customers.
