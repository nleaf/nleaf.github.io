    headline: The Scenario
    description: Trusting Expedient as its infrastructure as a service (IaaS) hosting
      service provider made much more financial sense than investing capital to build
      out an in-house data center for Omnyx.

    headline: The Challenge
    description: '"The cost of maintaining production-ready data center infrastructure
      - redundant power, proper fire suppression and multi-homed backbone connectivity
      - for a company of our size would be daunting," Howard said.'

    headline: The Solution
    description: Omnyx is growing in size, scope, reach and revenue, which requires
      more compute capacity. Expedient allows Omnyx to scale its infrastructure without
      missing a beat, allowing it to meet the needs of the pathologists using its
      software and products.
