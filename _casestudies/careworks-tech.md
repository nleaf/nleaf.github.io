    headline: The Scenario
    description: For CareWorks Tech, who wanted to get out of data center management
      but still needed to provide cloud and colocation services to its customers,
      it was imperative to find a partner with demonstrated excellence in those core
      infrastructure competencies.

    headline: The Challenge
    description: Should CareWorks Tech continue to invest time and resources in data
      center management, or instead refocus on its core managed services and free
      resources to drive increased revenues for the business by becoming trusted advisors
      and consultants to existing customers and potential clients?
