    headline: The Scenario
    description: Columbus Metropolitan Library’s Information Technology team, led
      by Senior Director of Information Technology Burton Bardus, knew it was time
      for some changes. The library’s infrastructure, including its entire production
      environment, was in-house at the library data center and approaching end of
      life.

    headline: The Challenge
    description: Further, CML’s disaster recovery plan was outdated and hadn’t recently
      been put through the rigors of full testing; the team lacked confidence in its
      ability to recover critical applications in the face of a disaster. And with
      more than 650,000 cardholders relying on CML for a variety of services and resources,
      it was imperative to the team that they find a stable solution for its undersized
      infrastructure and moderate disaster recovery plan.

    headline: The Solution
    description: "“We looked very briefly at a rebuild, but there were a lot of things
      that made sense about moving to the cloud,” said Bardus. “We were able to expand
      everything we were doing with the Expedient partnership, including having a
      retention policy in place that allowed our files to be backed up while expanding
      what we were putting in our storage environment by moving to a disk-based backup
      solution.”"
