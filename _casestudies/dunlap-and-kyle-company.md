    headline: The Scenario
    description: Dunlap and Kyle relies upon a small internal IT staff to keep both
      its retail and wholesale distribution businesses up and running. Before migrating
      its production environment to Expedient, the company supported the IT needs
      of its employees and various locations with centralized IT infrastructure hosted
      at its headquarters.

    headline: The Challenge
    description: While Dunlap and Kyle had implemented a DIY disaster recovery solution
      to protect its IT environment, the centralized nature of its legacy RS/6000-based
      system left the company vulnerable to IT downtime.

    headline: The Solution
    description: While Hill was originally going to enlist Expedient only as a colocation
      provider for the company’s new DR infrastructure, he decided to migrate Dunlap
      and Kyle’s entire production environment to Expedient’s cloud and then use a
      second Expedient site as the replication target for failover.
