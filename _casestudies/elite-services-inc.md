  quote: The bottom line is trying to get those scary tasks of handling data securely
    and making sure that you're appropriately scaled to do that kind of work, and
    handing that off to Expedient gives us the peace of mind so we don't have to worry
    about that on a day-to-day basis.

    headline: The Scenario
    description: In order to offer the best experience, Elite must stay focused on
      improving its practices on a daily basis, so the company relies on Expedient
      to handle all of its day-to-day IT functions.

    headline: The Challenge
    description: The nature of Elite's business has it competing against much larger
      corporations for customers, so while it can offer the same services with a more
      personal touch, it must be able to prove to potential customers that it can
      compete with the "big boys" on technology and service.

    headline: The Solution
    description: '"We want to continue to gain more market share and to advance technically,
      from a software development standpoint, so we will need Expedient from a scalability
      standpoint so as we grow, we just order more resources," Watson said.'
