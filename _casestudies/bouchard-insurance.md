    headline: The Scenario
    description: When Brian Polak joined Bouchard Insurance in 2015, one of his first
      orders of business as Director of Information Technology was to select a disaster
      recovery solution for Bouchard’s virtual desktop infrastructure – a critical
      capability for an organization with a mission to be available anytime a client
      claim event occurs.

    headline: The Challenge
    description: Headquartered in Clearwater, FL, but with offices in Tampa, Ft. Myers,
      Kissimmee, Orlando, and Sarasota, Bouchard Insurance is no stranger to its share
      of hurricanes; Polak knew that Bouchard’s existing disaster recovery plan was
      not up to the standards Bouchard, and its clients, deserved.

    headline: The Solution
    description: Expedient’s Push Button DR solution gave Bouchard Insurance the ability
      to failover from its production environment in Florida to an Expedient data
      center nearly 1,000 miles away, while ensuring that the failover was as turnkey
      as possible by dynamically maintaining Bouchard’s IP scheme at the backup site.
