Expedient respects the privacy of its users. The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain the types of information Expedient obtains about users, how the information is obtained, how it is used, how it may be disclosed to others and how users may restrict its use or disclosure. Expedient reserves the right to revise this privacy policy, while also revising its practices regarding the collection or use of other information obtained from users in the future.

## Personally Identifiable Information

The only personally identifiable information Expedient obtains about individual users through Expedient services is information supplied voluntarily by users. Users may provide Expedient with name, address, telephone number, billing information, email address, domain name or URL or other personally identifiable information that Expedient may use for its own business purposes. Expedient may share such information with its partners which perform certain services for Expedient, and such partners shall have access to user information to the extent needed to perform their services or as necessary to advance Expedient’s business purposes, including the purpose of contacting users about new products and services, which may be of specific interest to users. However, our partners may not use such user information for any other purpose.

## Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Expedient does collect some non-personally identifiable generic information about users as a means of measuring the effectiveness of Expedient services. Expedient servers monitor and identify certain user information in the normal course of operation. We collect this information only in the aggregate, and use it to evaluate and improve Expedient services and to provide targeted information that may be of interest to users. The following are examples of non-personally identifiable generic information.

## IP Addresses

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to users’ computers when using the Internet. Web site servers can automatically identify individual computers by their IP address. Expedient collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information. Expedient does not intentionally link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information.

## Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that are used for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow Expedient to save certain information about users, such as a password or individual preferences, in order to facilitate and enhance users’ future activities with Expedient services. Expedient will not use cookies to retrieve information from the user’s computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as otherwise provided in this privacy policy, Expedient shall not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes and shall not share that information with any third parties for any reason.

## Computer Settings

Settings, technical and other information from the user’s computer, such as the user’s operating system, browser version, connectivity, various communication parameters and other information related to the operation and interaction of Expedient services may be collected by Expedient. Except as otherwise provided in this privacy policy, Expedient will use such information solely in order to provide technically appropriate formatting of information provided by Expedient and access to Expedient services. The collection of this information will not include any personally identifiable information about users.

## Non-Participation

Should User not wish to receive further contacts from Expedient, User should send a written request that Expedient not contact User. Please send the written request by U.S. mail in an envelope clearly marked “Privacy-Urgent” to Expedient Data Centers at Nova Tower One, 1 Allegheny Square, Pittsburgh, PA 15212, Attention: Privacy Policy.

## Disclosure Pursuant to Legal Process

Expedient shall, pursuant to applicable law, regulation or legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, allow access to all available and relevant User information in order to comply with such process and protect Expedient’s or User’s rights and property. Expedient may also allow access to User information in emergencies where physical safety may be at risk.

## Transfer of Business Assets

Expedient considers its User information to be one of its business assets. Should Expedient sell or transfer all or substantially all of its business assets to another entity, User information will be one of those transferred business assets.

## Third-party Websites

Expedient is not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of third party Web sites, including Web sites reached through Expedient Services. Other Web sites may have different privacy policies or no policy. User should review the privacy policies of any Web site before providing personal information.
